rise;--;doc3.txt;--;It allows us to say to those whose health care or tuition may rise faster than they can afford - life isn't fair.
rise;--;doc2.txt;--;I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise.
personnel;--;doc5.txt;--;An increase in the quality and quantity of U.S. personnel in training and advisory roles can guard against militia infiltration of Iraqi units; develop the trust and goodwill of Iraqi soldiers and the local populace; and lead to better intelligence while undercutting grassroots support for the insurgents.

rogue;--;doc5.txt;--;As we change strategy in Iraq, we should also think about what Iraq has taught us about America’s strategy in the wider struggle against rogue threats and international terrorism.

every;--;doc6.txt;--;Outstanding career officials who run the Nunn-Lugar program -- people like Col. Jim Reid and Andy Weber who are here this morning -- will be there every step of the way to ensure that U.S. interests are protected.
difficult;--;doc6.txt;--;It will be difficult.
difficult;--;doc3.txt;--;Well, I thought about it, and then I did what every wise man does when faced with a difficult decision: I prayed, and I asked my wife.
difficult;--;doc5.txt;--;Of course, in order to convince the various factions to embark on the admittedly difficult task of disarming their militias, the Iraqi government must also make headway on reforming the institutions that support the military and the police.

uncertain;--;doc5.txt;--;Throughout American history, there have been moments that call on us to meet the challenges of an uncertain world, and pay whatever price is required to secure our freedom.
uncertain;--;doc2.txt;--;Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend.

difference;--;doc3.txt;--;That even though we may get involved out of civic obligation every few years, we don't always have confidence that government can make a difference in our lives.

bringing;--;doc1.txt;--;America, it's time to start bringing our troops home.
bringing;--;doc6.txt;--;And the Kiev story is heading in the right direction - while we were in Ukraine, Dick, through his tireless and personal intervention, was able to achieve a breakthrough with that government, bringing that facility and others under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program.
bringing;--;doc3.txt;--;Thank you Roger Hickey and Bob Borosage for bringing us all together today and thank you for your leadership in the cause of a more progressive America.
timetable;--;doc5.txt;--;I am not suggesting that this timetable be overly-rigid.

pledge;--;doc2.txt;--;At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future.

entire;--;doc5.txt;--;But neither Iran nor Syria want to see a security vacuum in Iraq filled with chaos, terrorism, refugees, and violence, as it could have a destabilizing effect throughout the entire region ?
school;--;doc4.txt;--;I had just finished three years of work as a community organizer in low-income neighborhoods of Chicago, and was about to enroll in law school.
school;--;doc1.txt;--;After three years of this work, I went to law school, because I wanted to understand how the law should work for those in need.

issue;--;doc5.txt;--;It is simply not productive for us not to engage in discussions with Iran and Syria on an issue of such fundamental importance to all of us.

prevent;--;doc6.txt;--;Today, experts tell us that we're in a race against time to prevent this scenario from unfolding.
prevent;--;doc5.txt;--;We should also make it clear that, even after we begin to drawdown forces, we will still work with our allies in the region to combat international terrorism and prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction.
prevent;--;doc2.txt;--;But I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression.

force;--;doc3.txt;--;That we're better off if we dismantle it - if we divvy it up into individual tax breaks, hand 'em out, and encourage everyone to go buy your own health care, your own retirement security, your own child care, their own schools, your own private security force, your own roads, their own levees...
force;--;doc5.txt;--;The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs recently said that if a conflict arose in North Korea, we’d have to largely rely on the Navy and Air Force to take care of it, since the Army and Marines are engaged elsewhere.

leaders;--;doc3.txt;--;These are Americans who still dream big dreams -they just sense their leaders have forgotten how.
leaders;--;doc5.txt;--;In each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the American people ?

tired;--;doc3.txt;--;We're tired of being divided, tired of running into ideological walls and partisan roadblocks, tired of appeals to our worst instincts and greatest fears.
streets;--;doc4.txt;--;Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive.
streets;--;doc5.txt;--;They have seen their sons and daughters killed or wounded in the streets of Fallujah.
streets;--;doc2.txt;--;We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes.
direct;--;doc6.txt;--;"Let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved...For in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet.

past;--;doc1.txt;--;And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you.
past;--;doc3.txt;--;But in our past there has been another term for it - Social Darwinism - every man or women for him or herself.
past;--;doc5.txt;--;In the past, it has been movements for freedom from within tyrannical regimes that have led to flourishing democracies; movements that continue today.
past;--;doc2.txt;--;For eighteen long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past.
second;--;doc6.txt;--;I want to turn to a second critical area: biological weapons threat reduction programs.
second;--;doc3.txt;--;I've thought about how she lived to see a world war and a Great Depression and a second world war, and how she saw her brothers and uncles and nephews and cousins coming home from those wars and still have to sit at the back of a bus.

cost;--;doc5.txt;--;There is one other place where our mistakes in Iraq have cost us dearly ?
cost;--;doc2.txt;--;But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy.
lawyer;--;doc1.txt;--;But the life of a tall, gangly, self-made Springfield lawyer tells us that a different future is possible.
corner;--;doc3.txt;--;I went to bake sales and barber shops and if there were two guys standing on the corner I'd pull up and hand them literature.
corner;--;doc5.txt;--;We have been told that progress is just around the corner, and that when the Iraqis stand up, we will be able to stand down.
corner;--;doc2.txt;--;And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream.
largest;--;doc6.txt;--;Many of these aging research facilities have the largest, least secure quantities of highly enriched uranium in the world - the quickest way to a nuclear weapon.
largest;--;doc5.txt;--;But instead of effectively targeting this aid, we have seen some of the largest waste, fraud, and abuse of foreign aid in American history.
defining;--;doc2.txt;--;You have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington.
choices;--;doc1.txt;--;We'll have to make hard choices.
choices;--;doc5.txt;--;making the hard choices and sacrifices necessary to uphold our most deeply held values and ideals.
choices;--;doc2.txt;--;The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past.

even;--;doc4.txt;--;It can shield a war criminal - even one like Felicien Kabuga, suspected of helping to finance and orchestrate the Rwandan genocide - by allowing him to purchase safe haven for a time and robbing all humanity of the opportunity to bring the criminal to justice.
even;--;doc3.txt;--;That even though we may get involved out of civic obligation every few years, we don't always have confidence that government can make a difference in our lives.
even;--;doc5.txt;--;This means talking to our friends and, at times, even our enemies.
even;--;doc2.txt;--;Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend.
even;--;doc1.txt;--;As Lincoln organized the forces arrayed against slavery, he was heard to say: "Of strange, discordant, and even hostile elements, we gathered from the four winds, and formed and fought to battle through."
even;--;doc6.txt;--;As the Avian Influenza outbreak demonstrates, even the zealous Russian border guard is helpless against the global sweep of biological threats.

afghanistan;--;doc5.txt;--;if the Iranians and Syrians think they can use Iraq as another Afghanistan or a staging area from which to attack Israel or other countries, they are badly mistaken.
afghanistan;--;doc2.txt;--;I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan.
material;--;doc6.txt;--;We must safeguard these dangerous weapons, material, and expertise.

stood;--;doc3.txt;--;But while the world has changed around us, too often our government has stood still.
stood;--;doc2.txt;--;For eighteen long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past.
power;--;doc4.txt;--;Among other things, this recognition resulted in the coalition that came to power in the December elections of 2002.
power;--;doc1.txt;--;He tells us that there is power in hope.
power;--;doc3.txt;--;We are here tonight because we believe that in this country, we have it within our power to say "yes" to those questions - to forge our own destiny - to begin the world anew.
power;--;doc2.txt;--;And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced.
chicago;--;doc4.txt;--;My own city of Chicago has been the home of some of the most corrupt local politics in American history, from patronage machines to questionable elections.
chicago;--;doc1.txt;--;My work took me to some of Chicago's poorest neighborhoods.
chicago;--;doc3.txt;--;We had held a large rally the night before in the Southside of Chicago, which is where I live.

giving;--;doc2.txt;--;Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America.
jeopardy;--;doc4.txt;--;And yet, the reason I speak of the freedom that you fought so hard to win is because today that freedom is in jeopardy.
jeopardy;--;doc2.txt;--;Because for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women - students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors -- found the courage to keep it alive.
debate;--;doc5.txt;--;That policy-by-slogan will no longer pass as an acceptable form of debate in this country.
debate;--;doc2.txt;--;If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the next Commander-in-Chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have.
access;--;doc4.txt;--;Wealth declarations do little good if no one can access them, and accountability in government spending is not possible if no one knows how much was available and allocated to a given project in the first place.
access;--;doc1.txt;--;They write the checks and you get stuck with the bills, they get the access while you get to write a letter, they think they own this government, but we're here today to take it back.

capital;--;doc1.txt;--;It was with these ideas in mind that I arrived in this capital city as a state Senator.

new;--;doc1.txt;--;Together, starting today, let us finish the work that needs to be done, and usher in a new birth of freedom on this Earth.
new;--;doc3.txt;--;Our time to write a new chapter in the American story.
new;--;doc5.txt;--;And so going forward, I believe there are strategic lessons to be learned from this as we continue to confront the new threats of this new century.
new;--;doc2.txt;--;Change happens because the American people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time.
learned;--;doc4.txt;--;I learned how my father had grown up in a tiny village called Alego, near Siaya, during this period of tumult.
learned;--;doc1.txt;--;It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable - that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst.
learned;--;doc3.txt;--;They can say that this was the time when America learned to dream again.
learned;--;doc5.txt;--;And so going forward, I believe there are strategic lessons to be learned from this as we continue to confront the new threats of this new century.
learned;--;doc2.txt;--;And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.
order;--;doc5.txt;--;Of course, in order to convince the various factions to embark on the admittedly difficult task of disarming their militias, the Iraqi government must also make headway on reforming the institutions that support the military and the police.
ever;--;doc1.txt;--;That's why we made the tax system more fair and just for working families, and that's why we passed ethics reforms that the cynics said could never, ever be passed.
ever;--;doc3.txt;--;And ever since I met this frail, one-hundred-and-five-year-old African-American woman who had found the strength to leave her house and come to a rally because she believed that her voice mattered, I've thought about all she's seen in her life.
ever;--;doc2.txt;--;And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced.
public;--;doc4.txt;--;It is rooted in the bankrupt idea that the goal of politics or business is to funnel as much of the pie as possible to one's family, tribe, or circle with little regard for the public good.
public;--;doc6.txt;--;Not to mention the environmental and public health and safety catastrophe that could come from a failure to store and transport these materials safely and securely.
public;--;doc3.txt;--;And I understood the question because it revealed the cynicism people feel about public life today.
public;--;doc5.txt;--;in a public and unambiguous way ?
public;--;doc2.txt;--;They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values.
filled;--;doc4.txt;--;And yet, I discovered that for all his education, my father's life ended up being filled with disappointments.
filled;--;doc1.txt;--;And as people have looked away in disillusionment and frustration, we know what's filled the void.
filled;--;doc6.txt;--;Here in Washington, we saw what happened when just two letters filled with just a few grams of Anthrax were sent to the U.S. Senate.
filled;--;doc5.txt;--;But neither Iran nor Syria want to see a security vacuum in Iraq filled with chaos, terrorism, refugees, and violence, as it could have a destabilizing effect throughout the entire region ?

told;--;doc3.txt;--;Another girl, Mireya, listened as her friend told this story.
told;--;doc5.txt;--;But even as they have carried out their responsibilities with excellence and valor, they have also told me that there is no military solution to this war.
told;--;doc2.txt;--;They could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred.
proliferation;--;doc6.txt;--;But because of the size, secrecy, and scope of the Soviet biological weapons program, we are still dangerously behind in dealing with this proliferation threat.
proliferation;--;doc5.txt;--;Rather, the question is what strategies, imperfect though they may be, are most likely to achieve the best outcome in Iraq, one that will ultimately put us on a more effective course to deal with international terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and other critical threats to our security.
proliferation;--;doc2.txt;--;I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease.
iran;--;doc5.txt;--;It is simply not productive for us not to engage in discussions with Iran and Syria on an issue of such fundamental importance to all of us.
iran;--;doc2.txt;--;But I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression.

human;--;doc4.txt;--;It's a human problem, and it has existed in some form in almost every society.
men;--;doc4.txt;--;This is the Kenya that so many who came before you envisioned - all those men and women who struggled and sacrificed and fought for the freedom you enjoy today.
men;--;doc1.txt;--;Finally, there is one other thing that is not too late to get right about this war - and that is the homecoming of the men and women - our veterans - who have sacrificed the most.
men;--;doc2.txt;--;The men and women who gathered there could've heard many things.
answers;--;doc4.txt;--;As well as numerous Kenyan men and women who have refused to pay bribes to get civil servants to perform their duties; the auditors and inspectors general who have done the job before them accurately and fairly, regardless of where the facts have led; the journalists who asked questions and pushed for answers when it may have been more lucrative to look the other way, or whip up a convenient fiction.
answers;--;doc6.txt;--;The answers to these questions will require sustained involvement by the Executive Branch, Congress, non-governmental organizations, and the international community.
hundreds;--;doc5.txt;--;They have spent hundreds of billions of their hard-earned dollars on this effort ?
hundreds;--;doc2.txt;--;How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans?
lack;--;doc4.txt;--;This lack of access for Africa's agriculture and commodities has restricted an important engine of economic growth.
lack;--;doc1.txt;--;I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill.
lack;--;doc5.txt;--;Such lack of foresight is simply inexcusable.

oceans;--;doc2.txt;--;It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot.
disastrous;--;doc5.txt;--;The President’s decision to go to war in Iraq has had disastrous consequences for Afghanistan -- we have seen a fierce Taliban offensive, a spike in terrorist attacks, and a narcotrafficking problem spiral out of control.

others;--;doc6.txt;--;And the Kiev story is heading in the right direction - while we were in Ukraine, Dick, through his tireless and personal intervention, was able to achieve a breakthrough with that government, bringing that facility and others under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program.
others;--;doc5.txt;--;But there are many others.

iraq;--;doc2.txt;--;I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan.

change;--;doc4.txt;--;The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels.
change;--;doc1.txt;--;By ourselves, this change will not happen.
change;--;doc3.txt;--;Whether it's the war or Katrina or their health care or their jobs, you hear people say that we've finally arrived at a moment where something must change.

change;--;doc2.txt;--;I believe that as hard as it will be, the change we need is coming.
wait;--;doc4.txt;--;It cannot wait for other nations to act first.
wait;--;doc3.txt;--;And I've had enough of being told that all we can do about this is sit and wait and hope that the good fortune of a few trickles on down to everyone else in this country.
wait;--;doc5.txt;--;No matter how bad it gets, we are told to wait, and not ask questions.

kids;--;doc2.txt;--;And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance.
china;--;doc3.txt;--;It lets us say to the guy who worked twenty or thirty years in the factory and then watched his plant move out to Mexico or China - we're sorry, but you're on your own.
china;--;doc2.txt;--;This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news.
northern;--;doc5.txt;--;This force could help prevent the conflict in Iraq from becoming a wider war, consolidate gains in Northern Iraq, reassure allies in the Gulf, allow our troops to strike directly at al Qaeda wherever it may exist, and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region.

survey;--;doc4.txt;--;In fact, one recent survey showed that corruption in Kenya costs local firms 6% of their revenues, the difference between good-paying jobs in Kenya or somewhere else.
survey;--;doc5.txt;--;According to a Pew survey, 42% of Americans now agree with the statement that the U.S. should "mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own.”We cannot afford to be a country of isolationists right now.

military;--;doc2.txt;--;We have the most powerful military on Earth, but that's not what makes us strong.
luck;--;doc4.txt;--;I wish all of you luck in finding this courage in the days and months to come, and I want you to know that as your ally, your friend, and your brother, I will be there to help in any way I can.
luck;--;doc2.txt;--;Tough luck.

makes;--;doc1.txt;--;Let's be the generation that makes future generations proud of what we did here.
makes;--;doc2.txt;--;Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend.

invasion;--;doc5.txt;--;Much has been written about how the military invasion of Iraq was planned without any thought to what political situation we would find after Baghdad fell.
harm;--;doc5.txt;--;I said then and believe now that Saddam Hussein was a ruthless dictator who craved weapons of mass destruction but posed no imminent threat to the United States; that a war in Iraq would harm, not help, our efforts to defeat al Qaeda and finish the job in Afghanistan; and that an invasion would require an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences.
harm;--;doc2.txt;--;As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home.

secure;--;doc4.txt;--;The history of Africa is a history of ancient kingdoms and great traditions; the story of people fighting to be free from colonial rule; the heroism of not only of great men like Nkrumah and Kenyatta and Mandela, but also ordinary people who endured great hardship, from Ghana to South Africa, to secure self-determination in the face of great odds.

win;--;doc1.txt;--;I want to win that next battle - for better schools, and better jobs, and health care for all.
win;--;doc3.txt;--;And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the American people about why we are there and how we will win.
win;--;doc5.txt;--;It’s time that we listen to their concerns and win back their trust.
win;--;doc2.txt;--;And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States.

africa;--;doc4.txt;--;As a Senator from the United States, I believe that my country, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with Kenya and with Africa.
africa;--;doc6.txt;--;But we've all seen how it could take far less time for these weapons to leak out and travel around the world, fueling insurgencies and violent conflicts from Africa to Afghanistan.
africa;--;doc5.txt;--;In my travels to Africa, I have seen weak governments and broken societies that can be exploited by al Qaeda.
private;--;doc4.txt;--;Of course, the best way to reduce bureaucracy and increase pay is to create more private sector jobs.
private;--;doc3.txt;--;That we're better off if we dismantle it - if we divvy it up into individual tax breaks, hand 'em out, and encourage everyone to go buy your own health care, your own retirement security, your own child care, their own schools, your own private security force, your own roads, their own levees...

scandal;--;doc4.txt;--;This coalition succeeded by promising change, and their early gestures - the dismissal of the shaky judges, the renewed vigor of the investigation into the Goldenberg scandal, the calls for real disclosure of elected officials' personal wealth - were all promising.
scandal;--;doc3.txt;--;In a century just six years old, our faith has been shaken by war and terror, disaster and despair, threats to the middle-class dream, and scandal and corruption in our government.

crisis;--;doc1.txt;--;We can turn this crisis of global warming into a moment of opportunity for innovation, and job creation, and an incentive for businesses that will serve as a model for the world.
crisis;--;doc3.txt;--;The time for our party's identity crisis is over.
market;--;doc6.txt;--;We've heard the horror stories - attempts by rogue states to recruit former Soviet weapons scientists; terrorists shopping for weapons grade materials on the black market.
market;--;doc3.txt;--;Yes, our greatness as a nation has depended on individual initiative, on a belief in the free market.
market;--;doc2.txt;--;It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road.
standing;--;doc6.txt;--;I found him standing about fifteen feet away, all the way in the back of the room.

use;--;doc4.txt;--;So if the government found ways to downsize the bureaucracy - to cut out the positions that aren't necessary or useful - it could use the extra money to increase the salary of other government officials.
use;--;doc6.txt;--;While they are often difficult to use, they are easy to transport, hard to detect, and, as we saw in Kiev, not always well secured.
use;--;doc5.txt;--;if the Iranians and Syrians think they can use Iraq as another Afghanistan or a staging area from which to attack Israel or other countries, they are badly mistaken.

troops;--;doc3.txt;--;I've had enough of being told that we can't afford body armor for our troops and health care for our veterans and benefits for the wounded heroes who've risked their lives for this country.

working;--;doc1.txt;--;What's stopped us is the failure of leadership, the smallness of our politics - the ease with which we're distracted by the petty and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough decisions, our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems.
working;--;doc6.txt;--;It's important for senior officials to go and visit these sites, to check their progress and shortcomings; to see what's working and what's not.
working;--;doc3.txt;--;The problem isn't that their philosophy isn't working the way it's supposed to - it's that it is.

working;--;doc2.txt;--;I will cut taxes - cut taxes - for 95% of all working families.

army;--;doc5.txt;--;The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs recently said that if a conflict arose in North Korea, we’d have to largely rely on the Navy and Air Force to take care of it, since the Army and Marines are engaged elsewhere.
army;--;doc2.txt;--;I'll recruit an army of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries and give them more support.

remains;--;doc6.txt;--;Much of what President Kennedy described in 1963 remains true to this day - and we owe it to ourselves and our children to get it right.
remains;--;doc5.txt;--;And I believe that it remains possible to salvage an acceptable outcome to this long and misguided war.
objectives;--;doc5.txt;--;There is no reason to believe that more of the same will achieve these objectives in Iraq.
voters;--;doc3.txt;--;And she saw young people of every race and every creed take a bus down to Mississippi and Alabama to register voters because they believed.
voters;--;doc2.txt;--;Because if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare the voters.

visit;--;doc6.txt;--;It's important for senior officials to go and visit these sites, to check their progress and shortcomings; to see what's working and what's not.

two;--;doc1.txt;--;I moved to Illinois over two decades ago.
two;--;doc6.txt;--;On our trip, we saw two areas where this is possible: elimination of heavy conventional weapons, and interdiction efforts to help stop the flow of dangerous materials across borders.
two;--;doc3.txt;--;At one point, Kozol tells about his trip to Fremont High School in Los Angeles, where he met a girl who tells him that she'd taken hairdressing twice, because there were actually two different levels offered by the high school.
two;--;doc5.txt;--;300,000 Iraqi security forces have supposedly been recruited and trained over the last two years, and yet American troop levels have not been reduced by a single soldier.
two;--;doc2.txt;--;When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed.

next;--;doc6.txt;--;Some weapons experts believe that terrorists are likely to find enough fissile material to build a bomb in the next ten years - and we can imagine with horror what the world will be like if they succeed.
next;--;doc5.txt;--;This must end in the next session of Congress, when we reassert our authority to oversee the management of this war.
next;--;doc2.txt;--;If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the next Commander-in-Chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have.
fortune;--;doc3.txt;--;And I've had enough of being told that all we can do about this is sit and wait and hope that the good fortune of a few trickles on down to everyone else in this country.
fortune;--;doc2.txt;--;We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work.
live;--;doc4.txt;--;I know that while recent reports have pointed to strong economic growth in this country, 56% of Kenyans still live in poverty.
live;--;doc3.txt;--;And I've wondered - if she is lucky enough to live as long as 105-year-old Marguerite Lewis, if she someday has the chance to look back across the twenty-first century, what will she see?

doubt;--;doc2.txt;--;Now let there be no doubt.
call;--;doc1.txt;--;Today we are called once more - and it is time for our generation to answer that call.
call;--;doc3.txt;--;They'd call me "Alabama," or they'd call me "Yo Mama."
call;--;doc5.txt;--;By redeploying from Iraq to Afghanistan, we will answer NATO’s call for more troops and provide a much-needed boost to this critical fight against terrorism.
call;--;doc2.txt;--;And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.
opposed;--;doc1.txt;--;Most of you know I opposed this war from the start.
opposed;--;doc2.txt;--;For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face.
save;--;doc1.txt;--;Let's make it possible for hardworking Americans to save for retirement.
save;--;doc2.txt;--;Not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save.
taken;--;doc6.txt;--;Additionally, in the last few years, we've seen some disturbing trends from Russia itself - the deterioration of democracy and the rule of law, the abuses that have taken place in Chechnya, Russian meddling in the former Soviet Union - that raise serious questions about our relationship.
taken;--;doc3.txt;--;At one point, Kozol tells about his trip to Fremont High School in Los Angeles, where he met a girl who tells him that she'd taken hairdressing twice, because there were actually two different levels offered by the high school.

syrians;--;doc5.txt;--;if the Iranians and Syrians think they can use Iraq as another Afghanistan or a staging area from which to attack Israel or other countries, they are badly mistaken.
markets;--;doc4.txt;--;As a result, many African nations have been asked to liberalize their markets without reciprocal concessions from mature economies.
markets;--;doc5.txt;--;free markets, a free press, a strong civil society ?
tell;--;doc4.txt;--;Since that time I have known him through stories - those my mother would tell and those I heard from my relatives here in Kenya on my last trip to this country.
tell;--;doc3.txt;--;Don't let anyone tell you we don't know what we stand for and don't doubt it yourselves.
tell;--;doc5.txt;--;And it is not enough for the President to tell us that victory in this war is simply a matter of American resolve.
tell;--;doc2.txt;--;The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang-violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals.
tell;--;doc1.txt;--;It was here, in Springfield, where I saw all that is America converge - farmers and teachers, businessmen and laborers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamoring to be heard.
tell;--;doc6.txt;--;Today, experts tell us that we're in a race against time to prevent this scenario from unfolding.
today;--;doc4.txt;--;In today's Kenya - a Kenya already more open and less repressive than in my father's day - it is that courage that will bring the reform so many of you so desperately want and deserve.
today;--;doc3.txt;--;And I think that we face one of those moments today.
today;--;doc5.txt;--;I spoke here a year ago and delivered a message about Iraq that was similar to the one I did today.
today;--;doc2.txt;--;And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream.
today;--;doc1.txt;--;Together, starting today, let us finish the work that needs to be done, and usher in a new birth of freedom on this Earth.
today;--;doc6.txt;--;And so the question we need to be asking ourselves today is, what is the future of this program?
secured;--;doc6.txt;--;While they are often difficult to use, they are easy to transport, hard to detect, and, as we saw in Kiev, not always well secured.
secured;--;doc5.txt;--;They have battled insurgents, secured cities, and maintained some semblance of order in Iraq.
bureaucracy;--;doc4.txt;--;Of course, the best way to reduce bureaucracy and increase pay is to create more private sector jobs.
bureaucracy;--;doc1.txt;--;We can control costs by focusing on prevention, by providing better treatment to the chronically ill, and using technology to cut the bureaucracy.
bureaucracy;--;doc2.txt;--;But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy.
sons;--;doc5.txt;--;They have seen their sons and daughters killed or wounded in the streets of Fallujah.
sons;--;doc2.txt;--;And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons.
sharing;--;doc1.txt;--;And as our economy changes, let's be the generation that ensures our nation's workers are sharing in our prosperity.
coffins;--;doc3.txt;--;That if you say the words "plan for victory" and point to the number of schools painted and roads paved and cell phones used in Iraq, no one will notice the nearly 2,500 flag-draped coffins that have arrived at Dover Air Force base.
coffins;--;doc5.txt;--;There have been too many flag-draped coffins, and there have been too many heartbroken families.
infrastructure;--;doc4.txt;--;It is painfully obvious that corruption stifles development - it siphons off scarce resources that could improve infrastructure, bolster education systems, and strengthen public health.
infrastructure;--;doc5.txt;--;As a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the U.S. troops remaining in Iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and American enclaves like the Green Zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists.
afford;--;doc1.txt;--;Every single person willing to work should be able to get job training that leads to a job, and earn a living wage that can pay the bills, and afford child care so their kids have a safe place to go when they work.
afford;--;doc3.txt;--;The party that won't just throw a few tax breaks at families who can't afford their insurance, but modernizes our health care system and gives every family a chance to buy insurance at a price they can afford.
afford;--;doc5.txt;--;According to a Pew survey, 42% of Americans now agree with the statement that the U.S. should "mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own.”We cannot afford to be a country of isolationists right now.

israel;--;doc5.txt;--;if the Iranians and Syrians think they can use Iraq as another Afghanistan or a staging area from which to attack Israel or other countries, they are badly mistaken.
israel;--;doc2.txt;--;You don't protect Israel and deter Iran just by talking tough in Washington.

hurt;--;doc2.txt;--;It should help us, not hurt us.
folks;--;doc3.txt;--;I don't think this administration is full of stupid people - I think there are a lot of smart folks in there.
train;--;doc4.txt;--;When we went upcountry, we traveled by train and matatu, with chickens and collard greens and sometimes babies placed in my lap.
train;--;doc5.txt;--;The second part of our strategy should be to couple this phased redeployment with a more effective plan that puts the Iraqi security forces in the lead, intensifies and focuses our efforts to train those forces, and expands the numbers of our personnel ?
train;--;doc2.txt;--;I am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time, a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night.
everywhere;--;doc3.txt;--;Americans everywhere are desperate for leadership.

known;--;doc6.txt;--;At its height in the late 1980's, this program stockpiled of some of the most dangerous agents known to man - plague, smallpox, and anthrax - to name just a few.
known;--;doc3.txt;--;How she saw unions rise up and a middle-class prosper, and watched immigrants leave distant shores in search of an idea known as America.
allies;--;doc5.txt;--;But we should know that our success in doing so is enhanced by engaging our allies so that we receive the crucial diplomatic, military, intelligence, and financial support that can lighten our load and add legitimacy to our actions.
hold;--;doc1.txt;--;Not just to hold an office, but to gather with you to transform a nation.
hold;--;doc5.txt;--;For only through this phased redeployment can we send a clear message to the Iraqi factions that the U.S. is not going to hold together this country indefinitely ?
hold;--;doc2.txt;--;Let us keep that promise - that American promise - and in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess.
effort;--;doc4.txt;--;I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see.
effort;--;doc6.txt;--;One way we could strengthen this relationship is by thinking about the Russians as more of a partner and less of a subordinate in the Cooperative Threat Reduction effort.
effort;--;doc5.txt;--;They have spent hundreds of billions of their hard-earned dollars on this effort ?
effort;--;doc2.txt;--;This too is part of America's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort.
women;--;doc4.txt;--;This is the Kenya that so many who came before you envisioned - all those men and women who struggled and sacrificed and fought for the freedom you enjoy today.
women;--;doc1.txt;--;Finally, there is one other thing that is not too late to get right about this war - and that is the homecoming of the men and women - our veterans - who have sacrificed the most.
women;--;doc3.txt;--;But in our past there has been another term for it - Social Darwinism - every man or women for him or herself.
women;--;doc2.txt;--;The men and women who gathered there could've heard many things.
town;--;doc6.txt;--;This is a city of two and a half million, and in a non-descript building right in the middle of town stood this facility that once operated on the fringes of the Soviet biological weapons program.
town;--;doc3.txt;--;It's a time where you can go to any town hall or street corner or coffee shop and hear people express the same anxiety about the future; hear them convey the same uncertainty about the direction we're headed as a country.
high;--;doc4.txt;--;The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels.
high;--;doc1.txt;--;Let's set high standards for our schools and give them the resources they need to succeed.
high;--;doc3.txt;--;At one point, Kozol tells about his trip to Fremont High School in Los Angeles, where he met a girl who tells him that she'd taken hairdressing twice, because there were actually two different levels offered by the high school.
high;--;doc5.txt;--;Sectarian violence has reached an all-time high, and 365,000 Iraqis have fled their homes since the bombing of a Shia mosque in Samarra last February.
high;--;doc2.txt;--;The times are too serious, the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook.
keeping;--;doc2.txt;--;The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang-violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals.
anything;--;doc3.txt;--;These are Americans who still believe in an America where anything's possible - they just don't think their leaders do.
anything;--;doc2.txt;--;The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives - on health care and education and the economy - Senator McCain has been anything but independent.
rights;--;doc1.txt;--;I became a civil rights lawyer, and taught constitutional law, and after a time, I came to understand that our cherished rights of liberty and equality depend on the active participation of an awakened electorate.
rights;--;doc3.txt;--;And at last - at last - she saw the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act.
pursue;--;doc2.txt;--;These are the policies I will pursue.
science;--;doc6.txt;--;In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose.
science;--;doc2.txt;--;Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology.
work;--;doc4.txt;--;And you will determine the direction of this country in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger Kenya where everyone rises together.
work;--;doc3.txt;--;It doesn't work.
work;--;doc5.txt;--;We should also make it clear that, even after we begin to drawdown forces, we will still work with our allies in the region to combat international terrorism and prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction.
work;--;doc2.txt;--;Not with so much work to be done.
work;--;doc1.txt;--;Together, starting today, let us finish the work that needs to be done, and usher in a new birth of freedom on this Earth.
work;--;doc6.txt;--;And we need to work together to obtain a bilateral agreement on biological threat reduction.
coalition;--;doc4.txt;--;This coalition succeeded by promising change, and their early gestures - the dismissal of the shaky judges, the renewed vigor of the investigation into the Goldenberg scandal, the calls for real disclosure of elected officials' personal wealth - were all promising.
remain;--;doc5.txt;--;We know these countries want us to fail, and we should remain steadfast in our opposition to their support of terrorism and Iran’s nuclear ambitions.
values;--;doc5.txt;--;And so we need to maintain a strong foreign policy, relentless in pursuing our enemies and hopeful in promoting our values around the world.
values;--;doc2.txt;--;They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values.
achieve;--;doc6.txt;--;And the Kiev story is heading in the right direction - while we were in Ukraine, Dick, through his tireless and personal intervention, was able to achieve a breakthrough with that government, bringing that facility and others under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program.
achieve;--;doc5.txt;--;And, while some have proposed escalating this war by adding thousands of more troops, there is little reason to believe that this will achieve these results either.
achieve;--;doc2.txt;--;Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.
servants;--;doc4.txt;--;As well as numerous Kenyan men and women who have refused to pay bribes to get civil servants to perform their duties; the auditors and inspectors general who have done the job before them accurately and fairly, regardless of where the facts have led; the journalists who asked questions and pushed for answers when it may have been more lucrative to look the other way, or whip up a convenient fiction.
believed;--;doc3.txt;--;She believed that we don't have to settle for equality for some or opportunity for the lucky or freedom for the few.
believed;--;doc5.txt;--;But I have long believed it has also been a failure of conception ?
making;--;doc4.txt;--;I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see.
making;--;doc1.txt;--;All of us running for president will travel around the country offering ten-point plans and making grand speeches; all of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead the country.
making;--;doc6.txt;--;By destroying these inventories, this is one place we could be making more of a difference.
making;--;doc5.txt;--;Prime Minister Maliki is not making our job easier.
making;--;doc2.txt;--;But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy.
closing;--;doc6.txt;--;The Department of Energy and others have certainly made progress in converting civilian reactors to low-enriched uranium, taking back spent fuel, and closing unnecessary facilities.
closing;--;doc2.txt;--;Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime - by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow.
root;--;doc5.txt;--;Our troops can help suppress the violence, but they cannot solve its root causes.
history;--;doc4.txt;--;My own city of Chicago has been the home of some of the most corrupt local politics in American history, from patronage machines to questionable elections.
history;--;doc3.txt;--;Our time to make a mark on history.
history;--;doc5.txt;--;But instead of effectively targeting this aid, we have seen some of the largest waste, fraud, and abuse of foreign aid in American history.
history;--;doc2.txt;--;You have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington.
control;--;doc1.txt;--;We can control costs by focusing on prevention, by providing better treatment to the chronically ill, and using technology to cut the bureaucracy.
control;--;doc6.txt;--;In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose.
control;--;doc5.txt;--;The President’s decision to go to war in Iraq has had disastrous consequences for Afghanistan -- we have seen a fierce Taliban offensive, a spike in terrorist attacks, and a narcotrafficking problem spiral out of control.
heart;--;doc4.txt;--;Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive.
heart;--;doc1.txt;--;It's time to admit that no amount of American lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone else's civil war.
heart;--;doc3.txt;--;She believed in this idea with all her heart and she saw this progress around her and she had faith that someday it would be her turn.
heart;--;doc5.txt;--;Month after month, and then year after year, I’ve watched with a heavy heart as my deepest suspicions about this war’s conception have been confirmed and exacerbated in its disastrous implementation.
iranians;--;doc5.txt;--;if the Iranians and Syrians think they can use Iraq as another Afghanistan or a staging area from which to attack Israel or other countries, they are badly mistaken.
violence;--;doc1.txt;--;I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill.
violence;--;doc5.txt;--;But neither Iran nor Syria want to see a security vacuum in Iraq filled with chaos, terrorism, refugees, and violence, as it could have a destabilizing effect throughout the entire region ?
medical;--;doc6.txt;--;Additional steps should also be taken to consolidate and secure dangerous pathogen collections, strengthen bio-reconnaissance networks to provide early warning of bio-attack and natural disease outbreaks, and have our experts work together to develop improved medical countermeasures.
medical;--;doc3.txt;--;I've had enough of the closed-door deals that give billions to the HMOs when we're told that we can't do a thing for the 45 million uninsured or the millions more who can't pay their medical bills.
give;--;doc1.txt;--;Let's recruit a new army of teachers, and give them better pay and more support in exchange for more accountability.
give;--;doc3.txt;--;I've had enough of the closed-door deals that give billions to the HMOs when we're told that we can't do a thing for the 45 million uninsured or the millions more who can't pay their medical bills.
give;--;doc5.txt;--;It is time to give Iraqis their country back.
give;--;doc2.txt;--;I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands.
we’re;--;doc5.txt;--;The National Intelligence Estimate, which details how we’re creating more terrorists in Iraq than we’re defeating, is the most obvious example of how the war is hurting our efforts in the larger battle against terrorism.
tax;--;doc1.txt;--;That's why we made the tax system more fair and just for working families, and that's why we passed ethics reforms that the cynics said could never, ever be passed.
tax;--;doc3.txt;--;The party that won't just throw a few tax breaks at families who can't afford their insurance, but modernizes our health care system and gives every family a chance to buy insurance at a price they can afford.
tax;--;doc2.txt;--;Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime - by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow.
accept;--;doc1.txt;--;Each of us, in our own lives, will have to accept responsibility - for instilling an ethic of achievement in our children, for adapting to a more competitive economy, for strengthening our communities, and sharing some measure of sacrifice.
accept;--;doc5.txt;--;I refuse to accept the possibility that I will have to come back a year from now and say the same thing.
accept;--;doc2.txt;--;To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation;With profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.
dependence;--;doc1.txt;--;All of us know what those challenges are today - a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our future, schools where too many children aren't learning, and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can.
dependence;--;doc3.txt;--;The party that will harness homegrown, alternative fuels and spur the production of fuel-efficient, hybrid cars to break our dependence on the world's most dangerous regimes.
dependence;--;doc2.txt;--;And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East.
states;--;doc4.txt;--;As a Senator from the United States, I believe that my country, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with Kenya and with Africa.
states;--;doc3.txt;--;But whenever I get in that mood, I think about something that happened to me on the eve of my election to the United States Senate.
states;--;doc5.txt;--;We would make clear in such a scenario that the United States would not be maintaining permanent military bases in Iraq, but would do what was necessary to help prevent a total collapse of the Iraqi state and further polarization of Iraqi society.
states;--;doc2.txt;--;Thank you, and God Bless the United States of America.
states;--;doc1.txt;--;And that is why, in the shadow of the Old State Capitol, where Lincoln once called on a divided house to stand together, where common hopes and common dreams still, I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for President of the United States.
states;--;doc6.txt;--;First, the Nunn-Lugar program should be more engaged in containing proliferation threats from Soviet-supplied, civilian research reactors throughout Russia and the Independent States.
heard;--;doc4.txt;--;Since that time I have known him through stories - those my mother would tell and those I heard from my relatives here in Kenya on my last trip to this country.
heard;--;doc1.txt;--;As Lincoln organized the forces arrayed against slavery, he was heard to say: "Of strange, discordant, and even hostile elements, we gathered from the four winds, and formed and fought to battle through."
heard;--;doc6.txt;--;We've heard the horror stories - attempts by rogue states to recruit former Soviet weapons scientists; terrorists shopping for weapons grade materials on the black market.
heard;--;doc2.txt;--;But what the people heard instead - people of every creed and color, from every walk of life - is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked.
something;--;doc6.txt;--;Now, few people understand these challenges better than the co-founder of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, Dick Lugar, and this is something that became particularly clear to me during one incident on the trip.
something;--;doc3.txt;--;I hoped for something else.
something;--;doc2.txt;--;But I stand before you tonight because all across America something is stirring.
want;--;doc4.txt;--;I wish all of you luck in finding this courage in the days and months to come, and I want you to know that as your ally, your friend, and your brother, I will be there to help in any way I can.
want;--;doc3.txt;--;When asked what was wrong, she said, "I don't want to take hairdressing.
want;--;doc5.txt;--;especially freedom from want and freedom from fear ?
want;--;doc2.txt;--;And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons.
want;--;doc1.txt;--;I want us to take up the unfinished business of perfecting our union, and building a better America.
want;--;doc6.txt;--;Right now, there are forces within the former Soviet Union and elsewhere that want these non-proliferation programs to stop.
sense;--;doc4.txt;--;To begin with, I discovered the warmth and sense of community that the people of Kenya possess - their sense of hopefulness even in the face of great difficulty.
sense;--;doc1.txt;--;And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you.
sense;--;doc3.txt;--;But it has also depended on our sense of mutual regard for each other, of mutual responsibility.
sense;--;doc5.txt;--;to pressure the Iraqi leadership to finally come to a political agreement between the warring factions that can create some sense of stability in the country and bring this conflict under control.
sense;--;doc2.txt;--;What has also been lost is our sense of common purpose - our sense of higher purpose.
organizer;--;doc4.txt;--;I had just finished three years of work as a community organizer in low-income neighborhoods of Chicago, and was about to enroll in law school.
organizer;--;doc1.txt;--;But a group of churches had offered me a job as a community organizer for $13,000 a year.
times;--;doc4.txt;--;Today, South Korea's economy is forty times larger than Kenya's.
times;--;doc1.txt;--;But too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and the special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own.
times;--;doc5.txt;--;This means talking to our friends and, at times, even our enemies.
times;--;doc2.txt;--;The times are too serious, the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook.
plague;--;doc6.txt;--;At its height in the late 1980's, this program stockpiled of some of the most dangerous agents known to man - plague, smallpox, and anthrax - to name just a few.
breaking;--;doc3.txt;--;And when she finally she saw hope breaking through the horizon in the Civil Rights Movement, she thought, "Maybe it's my turn."
breaking;--;doc5.txt;--;The overwhelming presence of our troops, our intelligence, and our resources in Iraq has stretched our military to the breaking point and distracted us from the growing threats of a dangerous world.
guarantee;--;doc3.txt;--;That in a global economy that's more connected and more competitive - we are the party that will guarantee every American an affordable, world-class, top-notch, life-long education - from early childhood to high school, from college to on-the-job training.
guarantee;--;doc5.txt;--;And so the question is not whether there is some magic formula for success, or guarantee against failure, in Iraq.
unions;--;doc1.txt;--;And let's allow our unions and their organizers to lift up this country's middle-class again.
unions;--;doc3.txt;--;How she saw unions rise up and a middle-class prosper, and watched immigrants leave distant shores in search of an idea known as America.
needs;--;doc1.txt;--;Together, starting today, let us finish the work that needs to be done, and usher in a new birth of freedom on this Earth.
needs;--;doc6.txt;--;In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose.
united;--;doc4.txt;--;As a Senator from the United States, I believe that my country, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with Kenya and with Africa.
united;--;doc3.txt;--;But whenever I get in that mood, I think about something that happened to me on the eve of my election to the United States Senate.

united;--;doc6.txt;--;And that is why the nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons within the borders of the former Soviet Union represent the greatest threat to the security of the United States - a threat we need to think seriously and intelligently about in the months to come.
end;--;doc4.txt;--;Of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see.
end;--;doc1.txt;--;But all of this cannot come to pass until we bring an end to this war in Iraq.
end;--;doc3.txt;--;Because in the end, we may be proud Democrats, but we are prouder Americans.
end;--;doc5.txt;--;cannot be built overnight, and they cannot be built at the end of a barrel of a gun.
end;--;doc2.txt;--;I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan.
goal;--;doc4.txt;--;It is rooted in the bankrupt idea that the goal of politics or business is to funnel as much of the pie as possible to one's family, tribe, or circle with little regard for the public good.
goal;--;doc5.txt;--;The goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of Iraq, prevent a further descent into civil war, and push the various Iraqi factions towards a political solution.
goal;--;doc2.txt;--;And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East.
democracy;--;doc4.txt;--;In a true democracy, it is what happens between elections that is the true measure of how a government treats its people.
democracy;--;doc6.txt;--;Additionally, in the last few years, we've seen some disturbing trends from Russia itself - the deterioration of democracy and the rule of law, the abuses that have taken place in Chechnya, Russian meddling in the former Soviet Union - that raise serious questions about our relationship.
democracy;--;doc3.txt;--;The party who believes that in this democracy, influence and access should begin and end with the power of the ballot.
democracy;--;doc5.txt;--;But even as we provide such help, we should be clear that the institutions of democracy ?
democracy;--;doc2.txt;--;This too is part of America's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort.
thing;--;doc1.txt;--;Finally, there is one other thing that is not too late to get right about this war - and that is the homecoming of the men and women - our veterans - who have sacrificed the most.
thing;--;doc3.txt;--;And it's the easiest thing in the world.
thing;--;doc5.txt;--;I refuse to accept the possibility that I will have to come back a year from now and say the same thing.
thing;--;doc2.txt;--;Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class.
provide;--;doc4.txt;--;What's worse - corruption can also provide opportunities for those who would harness the fear and hatred of others to their agenda and ambitions.
provide;--;doc6.txt;--;Additional steps should also be taken to consolidate and secure dangerous pathogen collections, strengthen bio-reconnaissance networks to provide early warning of bio-attack and natural disease outbreaks, and have our experts work together to develop improved medical countermeasures.
provide;--;doc3.txt;--;No more can we count on employers to provide health care and pensions and job training when their bottom-lines know no borders.
provide;--;doc5.txt;--;But even as we provide such help, we should be clear that the institutions of democracy ?
provide;--;doc2.txt;--;Yes, we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair.
divided;--;doc1.txt;--;Divided, we are bound to fail.
divided;--;doc3.txt;--;We're tired of being divided, tired of running into ideological walls and partisan roadblocks, tired of appeals to our worst instincts and greatest fears.
means;--;doc4.txt;--;Instead of opening businesses and engaging in commerce, people come to rely on patronage and payback as a means of advancing.
means;--;doc6.txt;--;"Let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved...For in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet.
means;--;doc5.txt;--;This means talking to our friends and, at times, even our enemies.
means;--;doc2.txt;--;Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it.
broader;--;doc5.txt;--;We need to keep these lessons in mind as we think about the broader threats America now faces ?
struggles;--;doc4.txt;--;And this is why the struggle against corruption is one of the great struggles of our time.
struggling;--;doc4.txt;--;But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict.
struggling;--;doc1.txt;--;All of us know what those challenges are today - a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our future, schools where too many children aren't learning, and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can.
write;--;doc1.txt;--;They write the checks and you get stuck with the bills, they get the access while you get to write a letter, they think they own this government, but we're here today to take it back.
write;--;doc3.txt;--;Our time to write a new chapter in the American story.
sunday;--;doc3.txt;--;We know that we've been called in churches and mosques, synagogues and Sunday schools to love our neighbors as ourselves; to be our brother's keeper; to be our sister's keeper.
places;--;doc4.txt;--;I don't have all the solutions or think that they'll be easy, but there are a few places that a country truly committed to reform could start.
places;--;doc3.txt;--;The sweeping changes brought by revolutions in technology have torn down walls between business and government and people and places all over the globe.
front;--;doc4.txt;--;When it broke down in front of Uhuru Park, we had to push until some joakalis came to fix it by the side of the road.
front;--;doc6.txt;--;Fortunately, however, we've made some good progress on this front.
answer;--;doc1.txt;--;Today we are called once more - and it is time for our generation to answer that call.
answer;--;doc5.txt;--;By redeploying from Iraq to Afghanistan, we will answer NATO’s call for more troops and provide a much-needed boost to this critical fight against terrorism.
instead;--;doc4.txt;--;Instead of unifying the country to move forward on solving problems, it divides neighbor from neighbor.
instead;--;doc1.txt;--;What's stopped us is the failure of leadership, the smallness of our politics - the ease with which we're distracted by the petty and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough decisions, our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems.
instead;--;doc3.txt;--;And in that movement, she saw women who were willing to walk instead of ride the bus after a day of doing somebody else's laundry and looking after somebody else's children because they walked for freedom.
instead;--;doc5.txt;--;a policy based on blind hope and ideology instead of fact and reality.
instead;--;doc2.txt;--;But what the people heard instead - people of every creed and color, from every walk of life - is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked.
ordinary;--;doc4.txt;--;Certainly it is not due to lack of effort on the part of ordinary Kenyans - we know how hard Kenyans are willing to work, the tremendous sacrifices that Kenyan mothers make for their children, the Herculean efforts that Kenyan fathers make for their families.
ordinary;--;doc2.txt;--;Because for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women - students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors -- found the courage to keep it alive.
firmly;--;doc5.txt;--;And so I firmly believe that we should convene a regional conference with the Iraqis, Saudis, Iranians, Syrians, the Turks, Jordanians, the British and others.
firmly;--;doc2.txt;--;Let us keep that promise - that American promise - and in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess.
faced;--;doc1.txt;--;I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill.
faced;--;doc3.txt;--;Well, I thought about it, and then I did what every wise man does when faced with a difficult decision: I prayed, and I asked my wife.
divides;--;doc4.txt;--;Instead of unifying the country to move forward on solving problems, it divides neighbor from neighbor.
divides;--;doc2.txt;--;This too is part of America's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort.
springfield;--;doc1.txt;--;But the life of a tall, gangly, self-made Springfield lawyer tells us that a different future is possible.
economy;--;doc4.txt;--;When people are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the country, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups.
economy;--;doc1.txt;--;And as our economy changes, let's be the generation that ensures our nation's workers are sharing in our prosperity.
economy;--;doc3.txt;--;That in a global economy that's more connected and more competitive - we are the party that will guarantee every American an affordable, world-class, top-notch, life-long education - from early childhood to high school, from college to on-the-job training.
economy;--;doc2.txt;--;Not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save.
criminal;--;doc4.txt;--;It can shield a war criminal - even one like Felicien Kabuga, suspected of helping to finance and orchestrate the Rwandan genocide - by allowing him to purchase safe haven for a time and robbing all humanity of the opportunity to bring the criminal to justice.
plant;--;doc1.txt;--;I joined with pastors and lay-people to deal with communities that had been ravaged by plant closings.
plant;--;doc3.txt;--;It lets us say to the guy who worked twenty or thirty years in the factory and then watched his plant move out to Mexico or China - we're sorry, but you're on your own.
plant;--;doc2.txt;--;When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed.
regional;--;doc4.txt;--;You enjoy a robust civil society; a press that's free, fair, and honest; and a strong partnership with my own country that has resulted in critical cooperation on terrorist issues, real strides in fighting disease and poverty, and an important alliance on fostering regional stability.
regional;--;doc5.txt;--;And so I firmly believe that we should convene a regional conference with the Iraqis, Saudis, Iranians, Syrians, the Turks, Jordanians, the British and others.
plans;--;doc1.txt;--;All of us running for president will travel around the country offering ten-point plans and making grand speeches; all of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead the country.
plans;--;doc2.txt;--;Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime - by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow.

sacrifice;--;doc1.txt;--;Each of us, in our own lives, will have to accept responsibility - for instilling an ethic of achievement in our children, for adapting to a more competitive economy, for strengthening our communities, and sharing some measure of sacrifice.
sacrifice;--;doc2.txt;--;It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well.

president;--;doc3.txt;--;And so I am eager to have this argument not just with the President, but the entire Republican Party over what this country is about.
president;--;doc5.txt;--;The President should announce to the Iraqi people that our policy will include a gradual and substantial reduction in U.S. forces.

kenyans;--;doc4.txt;--;The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels.

law;--;doc1.txt;--;I've worked with Republican Senator Dick Lugar to pass a law that will secure and destroy some of the world's deadliest, unguarded weapons.

law;--;doc3.txt;--;You teach law school, you're a civil rights attorney, you organize voter registration, you're a family man - why would you wanna go into something dirty and nasty like politics?"
disagree;--;doc1.txt;--;It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable - that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst.
disagree;--;doc2.txt;--;Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism.

ill-conceived;--;doc1.txt;--;For the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight.
ill-conceived;--;doc5.txt;--;Today, the Iraqi landscape is littered with ill-conceived, half-finished projects that have done almost nothing to help the Iraqi people or stabilize the country.

childhood;--;doc2.txt;--;I'll invest in early childhood education.
rather;--;doc4.txt;--;By focusing on building strong, independent institutions - like an anti-corruption commission with real authority - rather than cults of personality, they make a contribution to their country that will last longer than their own lives.
rather;--;doc5.txt;--;We can teach the soldiers to fight and police to patrol, but if the Iraqi government will not properly feed, adequately pay, or provide them with the equipment they need, they will continue to desert in large numbers, or maintain fealty only to their religious group rather than the national government.

ones;--;doc1.txt;--;Today we grieve for the families who have lost loved ones, the hearts that have been broken, and the young lives that could have been.
ones;--;doc2.txt;--;But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy.

responsibility;--;doc3.txt;--;That we have individual responsibility, but we also have collective responsibility to each other.
responsibility;--;doc5.txt;--;If we commit our troops anywhere in the world, it is our solemn responsibility to define their mission and formulate a viable plan to fulfill that mission and bring our troops home.
responsibility;--;doc2.txt;--;Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility - that's the essence of America's promise.

increasing;--;doc5.txt;--;Perhaps most importantly, some of these troops could be redeployed to Afghanistan, where our lack of focus and commitment of resources has led to an increasing deterioration of the security situation there.
agenda;--;doc4.txt;--;What's worse - corruption can also provide opportunities for those who would harness the fear and hatred of others to their agenda and ambitions.
agenda;--;doc3.txt;--;If we do all this, if we can be trusted to lead, this will not be a Democratic Agenda, it will be an American agenda.
pay;--;doc4.txt;--;As well as numerous Kenyan men and women who have refused to pay bribes to get civil servants to perform their duties; the auditors and inspectors general who have done the job before them accurately and fairly, regardless of where the facts have led; the journalists who asked questions and pushed for answers when it may have been more lucrative to look the other way, or whip up a convenient fiction.
pay;--;doc1.txt;--;Every single person willing to work should be able to get job training that leads to a job, and earn a living wage that can pay the bills, and afford child care so their kids have a safe place to go when they work.
pay;--;doc3.txt;--;I've had enough of the closed-door deals that give billions to the HMOs when we're told that we can't do a thing for the 45 million uninsured or the millions more who can't pay their medical bills.

worst;--;doc4.txt;--;Some of the worst actors on the international stage can also take advantage of the collective exhaustion and outrage that people feel with official corruption, as we've seen with Islamic extremists who promise purification, but deliver totalitarianism.
worst;--;doc1.txt;--;It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable - that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst.
worst;--;doc3.txt;--;We're tired of being divided, tired of running into ideological walls and partisan roadblocks, tired of appeals to our worst instincts and greatest fears.
addiction;--;doc2.txt;--;Now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution.

dream;--;doc3.txt;--;They can say that this was the time when America learned to dream again.

travel;--;doc1.txt;--;All of us running for president will travel around the country offering ten-point plans and making grand speeches; all of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead the country.
travel;--;doc6.txt;--;But we've all seen how it could take far less time for these weapons to leak out and travel around the world, fueling insurgencies and violent conflicts from Africa to Afghanistan.
travel;--;doc2.txt;--;It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot.
talk;--;doc1.txt;--;For the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight.

talk;--;doc2.txt;--;I know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk.
nearly;--;doc3.txt;--;That if you say the words "plan for victory" and point to the number of schools painted and roads paved and cell phones used in Iraq, no one will notice the nearly 2,500 flag-draped coffins that have arrived at Dover Air Force base.

six;--;doc5.txt;--;a phased redeployment of U.S. troops from Iraq on a timetable that would begin in four to six months.
majority;--;doc4.txt;--;And I know that the vast majority of people in this country desperately want to change this.
majority;--;doc5.txt;--;As a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the U.S. troops remaining in Iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and American enclaves like the Green Zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists.
help;--;doc4.txt;--;I wish all of you luck in finding this courage in the days and months to come, and I want you to know that as your ally, your friend, and your brother, I will be there to help in any way I can.
help;--;doc1.txt;--;I was proud to help lead the fight in Congress that led to the most sweeping ethics reform since Watergate.
help;--;doc6.txt;--;But when we think about the threat that these weapons pose to our global security, we cannot allow the U.S.-Russian relationship to deteriorate to the point where Russia does not think it's in their best interest to help us finish the job we started.
help;--;doc5.txt;--;But even as we provide such help, we should be clear that the institutions of democracy ?

office;--;doc1.txt;--;Not just to hold an office, but to gather with you to transform a nation.
office;--;doc6.txt;--;Five postal employees were killed and the Senate office buildings were closed for months.
office;--;doc2.txt;--;I realize that I am not the likeliest candidate for this office.
numbers;--;doc5.txt;--;We can teach the soldiers to fight and police to patrol, but if the Iraqi government will not properly feed, adequately pay, or provide them with the equipment they need, they will continue to desert in large numbers, or maintain fealty only to their religious group rather than the national government.
reminded;--;doc1.txt;--;It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America.
reminded;--;doc6.txt;--;But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at American University in 1963 about threats posed by the Soviet Union.
areas;--;doc6.txt;--;On our trip, we saw two areas where this is possible: elimination of heavy conventional weapons, and interdiction efforts to help stop the flow of dangerous materials across borders.
areas;--;doc5.txt;--;We need to continue to provide some basic reconstruction funding that will be used to put Iraqis to work and help our troops stabilize key areas.
move;--;doc4.txt;--;I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see.
move;--;doc1.txt;--;But too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and the special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own.
move;--;doc6.txt;--;For any of these efforts that I've mentioned to work as we move forward, we must also think critically and strategically about Washington's relationship with Moscow.
move;--;doc3.txt;--;It lets us say to the guy who worked twenty or thirty years in the factory and then watched his plant move out to Mexico or China - we're sorry, but you're on your own.
move;--;doc5.txt;--;But we need to also move towards more condition-based aid packages where economic assistance is contingent upon the ability of Iraqis to make measurable progress on reducing sectarian violence and forging a lasting political settlement.
mission;--;doc5.txt;--;If we commit our troops anywhere in the world, it is our solemn responsibility to define their mission and formulate a viable plan to fulfill that mission and bring our troops home.
mission;--;doc2.txt;--;As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home.

years;--;doc3.txt;--;It lets us say to the guy who worked twenty or thirty years in the factory and then watched his plant move out to Mexico or China - we're sorry, but you're on your own.
years;--;doc5.txt;--;300,000 Iraqi security forces have supposedly been recruited and trained over the last two years, and yet American troop levels have not been reduced by a single soldier.

years;--;doc1.txt;--;After all, every four years, candidates from both parties make similar promises, and I expect this year will be no different.
years;--;doc6.txt;--;Additionally, in the last few years, we've seen some disturbing trends from Russia itself - the deterioration of democracy and the rule of law, the abuses that have taken place in Chechnya, Russian meddling in the former Soviet Union - that raise serious questions about our relationship.
stability;--;doc4.txt;--;You enjoy a robust civil society; a press that's free, fair, and honest; and a strong partnership with my own country that has resulted in critical cooperation on terrorist issues, real strides in fighting disease and poverty, and an important alliance on fostering regional stability.
stability;--;doc5.txt;--;to pressure the Iraqi leadership to finally come to a political agreement between the warring factions that can create some sense of stability in the country and bring this conflict under control.

course;--;doc6.txt;--;Of course, Dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs he co-founded with Senator Sam Nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former Soviet Union after the Cold War.
course;--;doc5.txt;--;Of course, in order to convince the various factions to embark on the admittedly difficult task of disarming their militias, the Iraqi government must also make headway on reforming the institutions that support the military and the police.
earth;--;doc1.txt;--;Together, starting today, let us finish the work that needs to be done, and usher in a new birth of freedom on this Earth.
earth;--;doc2.txt;--;We have the most powerful military on Earth, but that's not what makes us strong.
destruction;--;doc6.txt;--;For a scientist or other employee to simply walk out of the lab with enough material to construct a weapon of mass destruction is far too easy, and the consequences would be far too devastating.
destruction;--;doc5.txt;--;and most importantly, the prevention of these terrorist organizations from obtaining weapons of mass destruction -- will require the cooperation of many nations.
shake;--;doc1.txt;--;And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you.
shake;--;doc3.txt;--;And in the midst of this rally, someone comes up to me and says that there's a woman who'd like to come meet you, and she's traveled a long way and she wants to take a picture and shake your hand.
argued;--;doc5.txt;--;Many who supported the original decision to go to war in Iraq have argued that it has been a failure of implementation.
argued;--;doc2.txt;--;When John McCain said we could just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights.
letters;--;doc6.txt;--;This was two letters.
cold;--;doc1.txt;--;Let me begin by saying thanks to all you who've traveled, from far and wide, to brave the cold today.
cold;--;doc6.txt;--;Throughout the Cold War, the Soviet Union was engaged in a massive undertaking in the field of germ warfare.
still;--;doc4.txt;--;As I said at the outset, I did not know my father well - he returned to Kenya from America when I was still young.
still;--;doc3.txt;--;But while the world has changed around us, too often our government has stood still.
still;--;doc5.txt;--;We should also make it clear that, even after we begin to drawdown forces, we will still work with our allies in the region to combat international terrorism and prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction.
still;--;doc2.txt;--;In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships.
still;--;doc1.txt;--;And that is why, in the shadow of the Old State Capitol, where Lincoln once called on a divided house to stand together, where common hopes and common dreams still, I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for President of the United States.
still;--;doc6.txt;--;But because of the size, secrecy, and scope of the Soviet biological weapons program, we are still dangerously behind in dealing with this proliferation threat.
perfect;--;doc4.txt;--;I know from these stories that my father was not a perfect man - that he made his share of mistakes and disappointed his share of people in his lifetime.
perfect;--;doc1.txt;--;In the face of a politics that's shut you out, that's told you to settle, that's divided us for too long, you believe we can be one people, reaching for what's possible, building that more perfect union.
perfect;--;doc5.txt;--;Dreams of democracy and hopes for a perfect government are now just that ?
chemical;--;doc6.txt;--;My third recommendation - which I'll just touch briefly on and let Senator Lugar talk about in more detail - is that we need to start thinking creatively about some of the next-generation efforts on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons.
chemical;--;doc3.txt;--;Four years after 9/11, I've had enough of being told that we can find the money to give Paris Hilton more tax cuts, but we can't find enough to protect our ports or our railroads or our chemical plants or our borders.
group;--;doc1.txt;--;But a group of churches had offered me a job as a community organizer for $13,000 a year.
group;--;doc5.txt;--;We can teach the soldiers to fight and police to patrol, but if the Iraqi government will not properly feed, adequately pay, or provide them with the equipment they need, they will continue to desert in large numbers, or maintain fealty only to their religious group rather than the national government.

personal;--;doc4.txt;--;This coalition succeeded by promising change, and their early gestures - the dismissal of the shaky judges, the renewed vigor of the investigation into the Goldenberg scandal, the calls for real disclosure of elected officials' personal wealth - were all promising.
personal;--;doc6.txt;--;And the Kiev story is heading in the right direction - while we were in Ukraine, Dick, through his tireless and personal intervention, was able to achieve a breakthrough with that government, bringing that facility and others under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program.
personal;--;doc5.txt;--;do not just come from deposing a tyrant and handing out ballots; they are only realized once the personal and material security of a people is ensured as well.
continued;--;doc4.txt;--;The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels.
continued;--;doc1.txt;--;It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people - as Americans.
continued;--;doc5.txt;--;The third part of our strategy should be to link continued economic aid in Iraq with the existence of tangible progress toward a political settlement.
fix;--;doc4.txt;--;When it broke down in front of Uhuru Park, we had to push until some joakalis came to fix it by the side of the road.
fix;--;doc2.txt;--;Not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save.
presence;--;doc4.txt;--;And corruption also erodes the state from the inside out, sickening the justice system until there is no justice to be found, poisoning the police forces until their presence becomes a source of insecurity rather than comfort.
presence;--;doc5.txt;--;The overwhelming presence of our troops, our intelligence, and our resources in Iraq has stretched our military to the breaking point and distracted us from the growing threats of a dangerous world.
responsibilities;--;doc5.txt;--;But even as they have carried out their responsibilities with excellence and valor, they have also told me that there is no military solution to this war.
responsibilities;--;doc2.txt;--;It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road.
actually;--;doc3.txt;--;At one point, Kozol tells about his trip to Fremont High School in Los Angeles, where he met a girl who tells him that she'd taken hairdressing twice, because there were actually two different levels offered by the high school.
actually;--;doc2.txt;--;When John McCain said we could just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights.
better;--;doc4.txt;--;We have the opportunity to muster the courage to fulfill the promise of our forefathers and lead our great nations towards a better future.
better;--;doc3.txt;--;We know that there are some things we do better together.
better;--;doc5.txt;--;An increase in the quality and quantity of U.S. personnel in training and advisory roles can guard against militia infiltration of Iraqi units; develop the trust and goodwill of Iraqi soldiers and the local populace; and lead to better intelligence while undercutting grassroots support for the insurgents.
better;--;doc2.txt;--;Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend.
better;--;doc1.txt;--;I want us to take up the unfinished business of perfecting our union, and building a better America.
better;--;doc6.txt;--;Now, few people understand these challenges better than the co-founder of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, Dick Lugar, and this is something that became particularly clear to me during one incident on the trip.
owe;--;doc1.txt;--;And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you.
owe;--;doc6.txt;--;Much of what President Kennedy described in 1963 remains true to this day - and we owe it to ourselves and our children to get it right.
owe;--;doc2.txt;--;The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect.
absence;--;doc1.txt;--;What's stopped us from meeting these challenges is not the absence of sound policies and sensible plans.
absence;--;doc5.txt;--;In the absence of a genuine commitment on the part of all of the factions in Iraq to deal with this issue, it is doubtful that a unified Iraqi government can function for long, and it is doubtful that U.S. forces, no matter how large, can prevent an escalation of widespread sectarian killing.
willing;--;doc4.txt;--;Certainly it is not due to lack of effort on the part of ordinary Kenyans - we know how hard Kenyans are willing to work, the tremendous sacrifices that Kenyan mothers make for their children, the Herculean efforts that Kenyan fathers make for their families.
willing;--;doc1.txt;--;Every single person willing to work should be able to get job training that leads to a job, and earn a living wage that can pay the bills, and afford child care so their kids have a safe place to go when they work.
willing;--;doc3.txt;--;Our faith has been shaken, but the people running Washington aren't willing to make us believe again.
willing;--;doc5.txt;--;We cannot compromise the safety of our troops, and we should be willing to adjust to realities on the ground.
willing;--;doc2.txt;--;It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work.
choose;--;doc3.txt;--;The party that won't make Americans choose between a health care plan that bankrupts the government and one that bankrupts families.
choose;--;doc2.txt;--;Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent.
valor;--;doc1.txt;--;Let us honor their valor by providing the care they need and rebuilding the military they love.
valor;--;doc5.txt;--;But even as they have carried out their responsibilities with excellence and valor, they have also told me that there is no military solution to this war.
policy;--;doc4.txt;--;A foreign policy that gives hope and opportunity to the people of this great continent.
policy;--;doc3.txt;--;Let it be said that we will conduct a smart foreign policy that battles the forces of terrorism and fundamentalism wherever they may exist by matching the might of our military with the power of our diplomacy and the strength of our alliances.
policy;--;doc5.txt;--;It is time to change our policy.
policy;--;doc2.txt;--;The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans -- Democrats and Republicans - have built, and we are here to restore that legacy.
weeks;--;doc3.txt;--;You know, you probably never thought you'd hear this at a Take Back America conference, but Newt Gingrich made a great point a few weeks ago.
weeks;--;doc5.txt;--;In just the past three weeks, he has ?
weeks;--;doc2.txt;--;And in the weeks ahead, I look forward to debating them with John McCain.
bipartisan;--;doc5.txt;--;Now, I am hopeful that the Iraq Study Group emerges next month with a series of proposals around which we can begin to build a bipartisan consensus.
might;--;doc1.txt;--;And I accepted the job, sight unseen, motivated then by a single, simple, powerful idea - that I might play a small part in building a better America.
might;--;doc3.txt;--;Let it be said that we will conduct a smart foreign policy that battles the forces of terrorism and fundamentalism wherever they may exist by matching the might of our military with the power of our diplomacy and the strength of our alliances.
might;--;doc5.txt;--;9/11 showed us that try as we might to ignore the rest of the world, our enemies will no longer ignore us.
easier;--;doc4.txt;--;In addition, we know that the more information the public is provided, the easier it will be for your Kenyan brothers and sisters out in the villages to evaluate whether they are being treated fairly by their public servants or not.
easier;--;doc5.txt;--;Prime Minister Maliki is not making our job easier.
easier;--;doc2.txt;--;I'll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars.
happened;--;doc1.txt;--;Most of all, let's be the generation that never forgets what happened on that September day and confront the terrorists with everything we've got.
happened;--;doc6.txt;--;Here in Washington, we saw what happened when just two letters filled with just a few grams of Anthrax were sent to the U.S. Senate.
happened;--;doc3.txt;--;But whenever I get in that mood, I think about something that happened to me on the eve of my election to the United States Senate.
thirty;--;doc3.txt;--;It lets us say to the guy who worked twenty or thirty years in the factory and then watched his plant move out to Mexico or China - we're sorry, but you're on your own.
thirty;--;doc2.txt;--;Washington's been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years, and John McCain has been there for twenty-six of them.
good;--;doc4.txt;--;It is rooted in the bankrupt idea that the goal of politics or business is to funnel as much of the pie as possible to one's family, tribe, or circle with little regard for the public good.
good;--;doc3.txt;--;And I've had enough of being told that all we can do about this is sit and wait and hope that the good fortune of a few trickles on down to everyone else in this country.
good;--;doc5.txt;--;For the fact is that there are no good options left in this war.
good;--;doc2.txt;--;I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise.
good;--;doc1.txt;--;And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you.
good;--;doc6.txt;--;Fortunately, however, we've made some good progress on this front.
somebody;--;doc1.txt;--;And when all else fails, when Katrina happens, or the death toll in Iraq mounts, we've been told that our crises are somebody else's fault.
somebody;--;doc3.txt;--;And in that movement, she saw women who were willing to walk instead of ride the bus after a day of doing somebody else's laundry and looking after somebody else's children because they walked for freedom.
greater;--;doc4.txt;--;We know that the temptation to take a bribe is greater when you're not making enough on the job.
greater;--;doc6.txt;--;But this is one story that shows our job is far from finished at a time when demand for these weapons has never been greater.
greater;--;doc3.txt;--;Will she see greater opportunities for every citizen of this country?
ideological;--;doc3.txt;--;We're tired of being divided, tired of running into ideological walls and partisan roadblocks, tired of appeals to our worst instincts and greatest fears.
ideological;--;doc5.txt;--;The notion that Iraq would quickly and easily become a bulwark of flourishing democracy in the Middle East was not a plan for victory, but an ideological fantasy.
civilian;--;doc6.txt;--;Besides the devastation they can cause to a civilian population, biological agents can also be effective in asymmetrical warfare against U.S. troops.
obtaining;--;doc5.txt;--;and most importantly, the prevention of these terrorist organizations from obtaining weapons of mass destruction -- will require the cooperation of many nations.
obtaining;--;doc2.txt;--;But I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression.
safe;--;doc4.txt;--;It can shield a war criminal - even one like Felicien Kabuga, suspected of helping to finance and orchestrate the Rwandan genocide - by allowing him to purchase safe haven for a time and robbing all humanity of the opportunity to bring the criminal to justice.
safe;--;doc1.txt;--;Politics doesn't have to divide us on this anymore - we can work together to keep our country safe.
safe;--;doc3.txt;--;Never again can we expect the oceans that surround America to keep us safe from attacks on our own soil.
safe;--;doc2.txt;--;Don't tell me that Democrats won't keep us safe.
impossible;--;doc4.txt;--;I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see.
impossible;--;doc1.txt;--;For that is our unyielding faith - that in the face of impossible odds, people who love their country can change it.
nation;--;doc4.txt;--;This means that the education and health care systems - issues that my own nation more than 200 years old still struggles with - lag behind, impacting its development.
nation;--;doc1.txt;--;Not just to hold an office, but to gather with you to transform a nation.
nation;--;doc3.txt;--;A while ago, I was reading through Jonathan Kozol's new book, Shame of a Nation, which tells of his travels to underprivileged schools across America.
nation;--;doc5.txt;--;money that could have been devoted to strengthening our homeland security and our competitive standing as a nation.
nation;--;doc2.txt;--;This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich.
break;--;doc4.txt;--;An accountable, transparent government can break this cycle.
break;--;doc3.txt;--;The party that will harness homegrown, alternative fuels and spur the production of fuel-efficient, hybrid cars to break our dependence on the world's most dangerous regimes.
shortcomings;--;doc6.txt;--;It's important for senior officials to go and visit these sites, to check their progress and shortcomings; to see what's working and what's not.
homegrown;--;doc1.txt;--;We can harness homegrown, alternative fuels like ethanol and spur the production of more fuel-efficient cars.
homegrown;--;doc3.txt;--;The party that will harness homegrown, alternative fuels and spur the production of fuel-efficient, hybrid cars to break our dependence on the world's most dangerous regimes.
taliban;--;doc5.txt;--;The President’s decision to go to war in Iraq has had disastrous consequences for Afghanistan -- we have seen a fierce Taliban offensive, a spike in terrorist attacks, and a narcotrafficking problem spiral out of control.
taliban;--;doc2.txt;--;I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan.
hands;--;doc2.txt;--;I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands.
schools;--;doc1.txt;--;I want to win that next battle - for better schools, and better jobs, and health care for all.
schools;--;doc3.txt;--;A while ago, I was reading through Jonathan Kozol's new book, Shame of a Nation, which tells of his travels to underprivileged schools across America.
schools;--;doc2.txt;--;Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology.
killed;--;doc6.txt;--;Five postal employees were killed and the Senate office buildings were closed for months.
killed;--;doc5.txt;--;They have seen their sons and daughters killed or wounded in the streets of Fallujah.
traveled;--;doc4.txt;--;I began to understand and appreciate the distance he had traveled - from being a boy herding goats to a student at the University of Hawaii and Harvard University to the respected economist that he was upon his return to Kenya.
traveled;--;doc3.txt;--;And in the midst of this rally, someone comes up to me and says that there's a woman who'd like to come meet you, and she's traveled a long way and she wants to take a picture and shake your hand.
traveled;--;doc5.txt;--;The American soldiers I met when I traveled to Iraq this year were performing their duties with bravery, with brilliance, and without question.
traveled;--;doc2.txt;--;Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest - a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours -- Hillary Rodham Clinton.
traveled;--;doc1.txt;--;Let me begin by saying thanks to all you who've traveled, from far and wide, to brave the cold today.
traveled;--;doc6.txt;--;As some of you know, Senator Lugar and I recently traveled to Russia, Ukraine, and Azerbaijan to witness firsthand both the progress we're making in securing the world's most dangerous weapons, as well as the serious challenges that lie ahead.
day;--;doc4.txt;--;In today's Kenya - a Kenya already more open and less repressive than in my father's day - it is that courage that will bring the reform so many of you so desperately want and deserve.
day;--;doc3.txt;--;And in that movement, she saw women who were willing to walk instead of ride the bus after a day of doing somebody else's laundry and looking after somebody else's children because they walked for freedom.
day;--;doc5.txt;--;the American people have determined that all these phrases have become meaningless in the face of a conflict that grows more deadly and chaotic with each passing day ?
day;--;doc2.txt;--;I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise.
day;--;doc1.txt;--;Most of all, let's be the generation that never forgets what happened on that September day and confront the terrorists with everything we've got.
day;--;doc6.txt;--;Much of what President Kennedy described in 1963 remains true to this day - and we owe it to ourselves and our children to get it right.
maintaining;--;doc5.txt;--;We would make clear in such a scenario that the United States would not be maintaining permanent military bases in Iraq, but would do what was necessary to help prevent a total collapse of the Iraqi state and further polarization of Iraqi society.
bootstraps;--;doc3.txt;--;It allows us to say to the child who didn't have the foresight to choose the right parents or be born in the right suburb - pick yourself up by your bootstraps.
bootstraps;--;doc2.txt;--;Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps - even if you don't have boots.
growing;--;doc4.txt;--;The Kenyan media has been courageous in uncovering and reporting on some of the most blatant abuses of the system, and there has been a growing recognition among people and politicians that this is a critical issue.
growing;--;doc5.txt;--;The overwhelming presence of our troops, our intelligence, and our resources in Iraq has stretched our military to the breaking point and distracted us from the growing threats of a dangerous world.
term;--;doc1.txt;--;Let's be the generation that says right here, right now, that we will have universal health care in America by the end of the next president's first term.
term;--;doc3.txt;--;But in our past there has been another term for it - Social Darwinism - every man or women for him or herself.
equality;--;doc1.txt;--;I became a civil rights lawyer, and taught constitutional law, and after a time, I came to understand that our cherished rights of liberty and equality depend on the active participation of an awakened electorate.
equality;--;doc3.txt;--;She believed that we don't have to settle for equality for some or opportunity for the lucky or freedom for the few.

name;--;doc3.txt;--;And I'd have to explain that I got the name from my father, who was from Kenya.
stabilize;--;doc5.txt;--;We need to continue to provide some basic reconstruction funding that will be used to put Iraqis to work and help our troops stabilize key areas.
always;--;doc6.txt;--;While they are often difficult to use, they are easy to transport, hard to detect, and, as we saw in Kiev, not always well secured.
always;--;doc3.txt;--;And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the American people about why we are there and how we will win.
always;--;doc5.txt;--;We must always reserve the right to strike unilaterally at terrorists wherever they may exist.
always;--;doc2.txt;--;"And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead.
university;--;doc4.txt;--;I began to understand and appreciate the distance he had traveled - from being a boy herding goats to a student at the University of Hawaii and Harvard University to the respected economist that he was upon his return to Kenya.
university;--;doc6.txt;--;But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at American University in 1963 about threats posed by the Soviet Union.
sacrificed;--;doc4.txt;--;This is the Kenya that so many who came before you envisioned - all those men and women who struggled and sacrificed and fought for the freedom you enjoy today.
sacrificed;--;doc1.txt;--;Finally, there is one other thing that is not too late to get right about this war - and that is the homecoming of the men and women - our veterans - who have sacrificed the most.
tyranny;--;doc1.txt;--;Let's be the generation that finally frees America from the tyranny of oil.
lifetime;--;doc4.txt;--;I know from these stories that my father was not a perfect man - that he made his share of mistakes and disappointed his share of people in his lifetime.
lifetime;--;doc5.txt;--;Thousands more have suffered wounds that will last a lifetime.
lifetime;--;doc2.txt;--;This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work.
realistic;--;doc5.txt;--;It may be politically advantageous for the President to simply define victory as staying and defeat as leaving, but it prevents a serious conversation about the realistic objectives we can still achieve in Iraq.
stopped;--;doc1.txt;--;What's stopped us is the failure of leadership, the smallness of our politics - the ease with which we're distracted by the petty and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough decisions, our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems.
victory;--;doc1.txt;--;But let us also understand that ultimate victory against our enemies will come only by rebuilding our alliances and exporting those ideals that bring hope and opportunity to millions around the globe.
victory;--;doc3.txt;--;That if you say the words "plan for victory" and point to the number of schools painted and roads paved and cell phones used in Iraq, no one will notice the nearly 2,500 flag-draped coffins that have arrived at Dover Air Force base.
victory;--;doc5.txt;--;It may be politically advantageous for the President to simply define victory as staying and defeat as leaving, but it prevents a serious conversation about the realistic objectives we can still achieve in Iraq.
truth;--;doc4.txt;--;The hard truth is that nations, by and large, will act in their self-interest and if Kenya does not act, it will fall behind.
truth;--;doc2.txt;--;The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives - on health care and education and the economy - Senator McCain has been anything but independent.
positions;--;doc4.txt;--;So if the government found ways to downsize the bureaucracy - to cut out the positions that aren't necessary or useful - it could use the extra money to increase the salary of other government officials.
positions;--;doc2.txt;--;But what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes.

found;--;doc6.txt;--;I found him standing about fifteen feet away, all the way in the back of the room.
found;--;doc3.txt;--;They can say that this was the time when America found its way.
found;--;doc2.txt;--;Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made.
went;--;doc4.txt;--;When we went upcountry, we traveled by train and matatu, with chickens and collard greens and sometimes babies placed in my lap.
went;--;doc1.txt;--;After three years of this work, I went to law school, because I wanted to understand how the law should work for those in need.
went;--;doc3.txt;--;And everywhere I went I'd get two questions:First, they'd ask, "Where'd you get that funny name, Barack Obama?"
went;--;doc5.txt;--;This was true for those who went to Lexington and Concord.
went;--;doc2.txt;--;This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news.
bills;--;doc1.txt;--;Every single person willing to work should be able to get job training that leads to a job, and earn a living wage that can pay the bills, and afford child care so their kids have a safe place to go when they work.
bills;--;doc3.txt;--;I've had enough of the closed-door deals that give billions to the HMOs when we're told that we can't do a thing for the 45 million uninsured or the millions more who can't pay their medical bills.
bills;--;doc2.txt;--;More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford to pay, and tuition that's beyond your reach.
partisan;--;doc3.txt;--;We're tired of being divided, tired of running into ideological walls and partisan roadblocks, tired of appeals to our worst instincts and greatest fears.
partisan;--;doc2.txt;--;The times are too serious, the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook.

side;--;doc2.txt;--;When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed.
mean;--;doc6.txt;--;But thinking of the Russians more as partners does mean being more thoughtful, respectful, and consistent about what we say and what we do.
mean;--;doc5.txt;--;This doesn’t mean abandoning our values and ideals; wherever we can, it’s in our interest to help foster democracy through the diplomatic and economic resources at our disposal.
mean;--;doc2.txt;--;So let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if I am President.
consolidate;--;doc6.txt;--;Additional steps should also be taken to consolidate and secure dangerous pathogen collections, strengthen bio-reconnaissance networks to provide early warning of bio-attack and natural disease outbreaks, and have our experts work together to develop improved medical countermeasures.
consolidate;--;doc5.txt;--;This force could help prevent the conflict in Iraq from becoming a wider war, consolidate gains in Northern Iraq, reassure allies in the Gulf, allow our troops to strike directly at al Qaeda wherever it may exist, and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region.
lie;--;doc6.txt;--;As some of you know, Senator Lugar and I recently traveled to Russia, Ukraine, and Azerbaijan to witness firsthand both the progress we're making in securing the world's most dangerous weapons, as well as the serious challenges that lie ahead.
lie;--;doc5.txt;--;It was true for those who lie buried at Gettysburg.
republican;--;doc1.txt;--;I've worked with Republican Senator Dick Lugar to pass a law that will secure and destroy some of the world's deadliest, unguarded weapons.
republican;--;doc3.txt;--;And so I am eager to have this argument not just with the President, but the entire Republican Party over what this country is about.
republican;--;doc5.txt;--;Senators, Republican and Democrat, including myself, had also voted in favor of a resolution demanding that 2006 be a year of significant transition in Iraq.
republican;--;doc2.txt;--;For over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy - give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else.
everyone;--;doc4.txt;--;And you will determine the direction of this country in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger Kenya where everyone rises together.
everyone;--;doc6.txt;--;Everyone has a role to play, and everyone must accelerate this involvement.
everyone;--;doc3.txt;--;That we're better off if we dismantle it - if we divvy it up into individual tax breaks, hand 'em out, and encourage everyone to go buy your own health care, your own retirement security, your own child care, their own schools, your own private security force, your own roads, their own levees...

financial;--;doc4.txt;--;When African nations were just gaining independence, industrialized nations had decades of experience building their domestic economies and navigating the international financial system.
financial;--;doc5.txt;--;But we should know that our success in doing so is enhanced by engaging our allies so that we receive the crucial diplomatic, military, intelligence, and financial support that can lighten our load and add legitimacy to our actions.
billion;--;doc5.txt;--;So far, Congress has given the Administration unprecedented flexibility in determining how to spend more than $20 billion dollars in Iraq.
billion;--;doc2.txt;--;And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.
fairly;--;doc4.txt;--;As well as numerous Kenyan men and women who have refused to pay bribes to get civil servants to perform their duties; the auditors and inspectors general who have done the job before them accurately and fairly, regardless of where the facts have led; the journalists who asked questions and pushed for answers when it may have been more lucrative to look the other way, or whip up a convenient fiction.
generation;--;doc1.txt;--;Let us be the generation that begins this work.
generation;--;doc5.txt;--;And a report by our own intelligence agencies has concluded that al Qaeda is successfully using the war in Iraq to recruit a new generation of terrorists for its war on America.

house;--;doc3.txt;--;And ever since I met this frail, one-hundred-and-five-year-old African-American woman who had found the strength to leave her house and come to a rally because she believed that her voice mattered, I've thought about all she's seen in her life.

energy;--;doc1.txt;--;It will take your time, your energy, and your advice - to push us forward when we're doing right, and to let us know when we're not.
energy;--;doc6.txt;--;The Department of Energy and others have certainly made progress in converting civilian reactors to low-enriched uranium, taking back spent fuel, and closing unnecessary facilities.
energy;--;doc3.txt;--;Let it be said that we are the party of an energy independent America.
energy;--;doc2.txt;--;Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient.
hard;--;doc4.txt;--;And you will determine the direction of this country in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger Kenya where everyone rises together.
hard;--;doc1.txt;--;Let us begin this hard work together.
hard;--;doc6.txt;--;While they are often difficult to use, they are easy to transport, hard to detect, and, as we saw in Kiev, not always well secured.
hard;--;doc5.txt;--;making the hard choices and sacrifices necessary to uphold our most deeply held values and ideals.
hard;--;doc2.txt;--;I believe that as hard as it will be, the change we need is coming.
reduce;--;doc4.txt;--;Of course, the best way to reduce bureaucracy and increase pay is to create more private sector jobs.
reduce;--;doc6.txt;--;In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose.
reduce;--;doc5.txt;--;Americans were originally persuaded by the President to go to war in part because of the threat of weapons of mass destruction, and in part because they were told that it would help reduce the threat of international terrorism.
idea;--;doc4.txt;--;By rejecting the insulting idea that corruption is somehow a part of Kenyan culture, these heroes reveal the very opposite - they reveal a strength and integrity of character that can build a great country, a great future.
idea;--;doc1.txt;--;And I accepted the job, sight unseen, motivated then by a single, simple, powerful idea - that I might play a small part in building a better America.
idea;--;doc3.txt;--;The idea that everybody has a stake in the country, that we're all in it together and everybody's got a shot at opportunity.
idea;--;doc5.txt;--;This includes opening dialogue with both Syria and Iran, an idea supported by both James Baker and Robert Gates.
idea;--;doc2.txt;--;Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism.
used;--;doc6.txt;--;In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose.
used;--;doc3.txt;--;That if you say the words "plan for victory" and point to the number of schools painted and roads paved and cell phones used in Iraq, no one will notice the nearly 2,500 flag-draped coffins that have arrived at Dover Air Force base.
used;--;doc5.txt;--;We need to continue to provide some basic reconstruction funding that will be used to put Iraqis to work and help our troops stabilize key areas.
brother;--;doc4.txt;--;I wish all of you luck in finding this courage in the days and months to come, and I want you to know that as your ally, your friend, and your brother, I will be there to help in any way I can.
brother;--;doc3.txt;--;We know that we've been called in churches and mosques, synagogues and Sunday schools to love our neighbors as ourselves; to be our brother's keeper; to be our sister's keeper.
brother;--;doc2.txt;--;That's the promise of America - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper.
challenges;--;doc1.txt;--;What's stopped us from meeting these challenges is not the absence of sound policies and sensible plans.
challenges;--;doc6.txt;--;Now, few people understand these challenges better than the co-founder of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, Dick Lugar, and this is something that became particularly clear to me during one incident on the trip.
challenges;--;doc5.txt;--;In each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the American people ?
challenges;--;doc2.txt;--;The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past.
society;--;doc4.txt;--;It stifles innovation and fractures the fabric of the society.
society;--;doc3.txt;--;It's called the Ownership Society in Washington.
society;--;doc5.txt;--;free markets, a free press, a strong civil society ?

gates;--;doc2.txt;--;John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell - but he won't even go to the cave where he lives.
expect;--;doc1.txt;--;After all, every four years, candidates from both parties make similar promises, and I expect this year will be no different.
expect;--;doc3.txt;--;Never again can we expect the oceans that surround America to keep us safe from attacks on our own soil.
expect;--;doc2.txt;--;You understand that in this election, the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result.
year;--;doc4.txt;--;The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels.
year;--;doc1.txt;--;After all, every four years, candidates from both parties make similar promises, and I expect this year will be no different.
year;--;doc5.txt;--;I refuse to accept the possibility that I will have to come back a year from now and say the same thing.
year;--;doc2.txt;--;Why else would he define middle-class as someone making under five million dollars a year?
doubtful;--;doc5.txt;--;In the absence of a genuine commitment on the part of all of the factions in Iraq to deal with this issue, it is doubtful that a unified Iraqi government can function for long, and it is doubtful that U.S. forces, no matter how large, can prevent an escalation of widespread sectarian killing.
illinois;--;doc1.txt;--;I moved to Illinois over two decades ago.
illinois;--;doc2.txt;--;I've seen it in Illinois, when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work.
happen;--;doc1.txt;--;By ourselves, this change will not happen.
happen;--;doc5.txt;--;And this has been true for those of us who looked on the rubble and ashes of 9/11, and made a solemn pledge that such an atrocity would never again happen on United States soil; that we would do whatever it took to hunt down those responsible, and use every tool at our disposal ?
grandfather;--;doc4.txt;--;I learned about the brutal repression of Operation Anvil, the days of rape and torture in the "Pipeline" camps, the lives that so many gave, and how my grandfather had been arrested briefly during this period, despite being at the periphery of Kenya's liberation struggles.
grandfather;--;doc2.txt;--;Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill.
insurance;--;doc1.txt;--;That's why we were able to give health insurance to children in need.
insurance;--;doc3.txt;--;The party that won't just throw a few tax breaks at families who can't afford their insurance, but modernizes our health care system and gives every family a chance to buy insurance at a price they can afford.
insurance;--;doc2.txt;--;And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most.
special;--;doc1.txt;--;But too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and the special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own.
special;--;doc3.txt;--;And let it be said that we are the party of open, honest government that doesn't peddle the agenda of whichever lobbyist or special interest can write the biggest check.
special;--;doc5.txt;--;especially special forces ?
really;--;doc2.txt;--;In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society, but what it really means is - you're on your own.
large;--;doc4.txt;--;The hard truth is that nations, by and large, will act in their self-interest and if Kenya does not act, it will fall behind.
large;--;doc3.txt;--;We had held a large rally the night before in the Southside of Chicago, which is where I live.
large;--;doc5.txt;--;We can teach the soldiers to fight and police to patrol, but if the Iraqi government will not properly feed, adequately pay, or provide them with the equipment they need, they will continue to desert in large numbers, or maintain fealty only to their religious group rather than the national government.
given;--;doc4.txt;--;Wealth declarations do little good if no one can access them, and accountability in government spending is not possible if no one knows how much was available and allocated to a given project in the first place.
given;--;doc6.txt;--;But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at American University in 1963 about threats posed by the Soviet Union.
given;--;doc5.txt;--;So far, Congress has given the Administration unprecedented flexibility in determining how to spend more than $20 billion dollars in Iraq.
given;--;doc2.txt;--;Michelle and I are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education.
reducing;--;doc5.txt;--;But we need to also move towards more condition-based aid packages where economic assistance is contingent upon the ability of Iraqis to make measurable progress on reducing sectarian violence and forging a lasting political settlement.
reducing;--;doc2.txt;--;We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country.
funding;--;doc6.txt;--;While the government of Ukraine is making progress here, the limited funding they have means that at the current pace, it will take sixty years to dismantle these weapons.
funding;--;doc5.txt;--;We need to continue to provide some basic reconstruction funding that will be used to put Iraqis to work and help our troops stabilize key areas.
kiev;--;doc6.txt;--;And the Kiev story is heading in the right direction - while we were in Ukraine, Dick, through his tireless and personal intervention, was able to achieve a breakthrough with that government, bringing that facility and others under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program.
factors;--;doc4.txt;--;Other issues, such as resource extraction and the drain of human capital have also been major factors.
defend;--;doc2.txt;--;As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home.
since;--;doc4.txt;--;Since that time I have known him through stories - those my mother would tell and those I heard from my relatives here in Kenya on my last trip to this country.
since;--;doc1.txt;--;I was proud to help lead the fight in Congress that led to the most sweeping ethics reform since Watergate.
since;--;doc3.txt;--;And ever since I met this frail, one-hundred-and-five-year-old African-American woman who had found the strength to leave her house and come to a rally because she believed that her voice mattered, I've thought about all she's seen in her life.
since;--;doc5.txt;--;The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs recently said that if a conflict arose in North Korea, we’d have to largely rely on the Navy and Air Force to take care of it, since the Army and Marines are engaged elsewhere.
crucial;--;doc1.txt;--;And although government will play a crucial role in bringing about the changes we need, more money and programs alone will not get us where we need to go.
crucial;--;doc5.txt;--;But we should know that our success in doing so is enhanced by engaging our allies so that we receive the crucial diplomatic, military, intelligence, and financial support that can lighten our load and add legitimacy to our actions.
chaos;--;doc5.txt;--;But neither Iran nor Syria want to see a security vacuum in Iraq filled with chaos, terrorism, refugees, and violence, as it could have a destabilizing effect throughout the entire region ?
research;--;doc1.txt;--;Let's make college more affordable, and let's invest in scientific research, and let's lay down broadband lines through the heart of inner cities and rural towns all across America.
research;--;doc6.txt;--;Many of these aging research facilities have the largest, least secure quantities of highly enriched uranium in the world - the quickest way to a nuclear weapon.
looking;--;doc4.txt;--;Looking out at this crowd of young people, I have faith that you will fight this fight too.
looking;--;doc6.txt;--;Right now, rogue states and despotic regimes are looking to begin or accelerate their own nuclear programs.
looking;--;doc3.txt;--;And in that movement, she saw women who were willing to walk instead of ride the bus after a day of doing somebody else's laundry and looking after somebody else's children because they walked for freedom.
acting;--;doc5.txt;--;As a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the U.S. troops remaining in Iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and American enclaves like the Green Zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists.
race;--;doc1.txt;--;That's why I'm in this race.
race;--;doc6.txt;--;Today, experts tell us that we're in a race against time to prevent this scenario from unfolding.
race;--;doc3.txt;--;And she saw young people of every race and every creed take a bus down to Mississippi and Alabama to register voters because they believed.
health;--;doc4.txt;--;It is painfully obvious that corruption stifles development - it siphons off scarce resources that could improve infrastructure, bolster education systems, and strengthen public health.
health;--;doc1.txt;--;I want to win that next battle - for better schools, and better jobs, and health care for all.
health;--;doc6.txt;--;Not to mention the environmental and public health and safety catastrophe that could come from a failure to store and transport these materials safely and securely.
health;--;doc3.txt;--;The party that won't just throw a few tax breaks at families who can't afford their insurance, but modernizes our health care system and gives every family a chance to buy insurance at a price they can afford.
health;--;doc2.txt;--;I've seen it in Illinois, when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work.
hiv/aids;--;doc4.txt;--;It makes it impossible to respond effectively to crises -- whether it's the HIV/AIDS pandemic or malaria or crippling drought.
got;--;doc1.txt;--;Most of all, let's be the generation that never forgets what happened on that September day and confront the terrorists with everything we've got.
got;--;doc3.txt;--;The idea that everybody has a stake in the country, that we're all in it together and everybody's got a shot at opportunity.
got;--;doc2.txt;--;In the young people who voted for the first time, and in those who got involved again after a very long time.
gratitude;--;doc2.txt;--;The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect.
cause;--;doc1.txt;--;And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you.
cause;--;doc6.txt;--;Besides the devastation they can cause to a civilian population, biological agents can also be effective in asymmetrical warfare against U.S. troops.
cause;--;doc3.txt;--;Thank you Roger Hickey and Bob Borosage for bringing us all together today and thank you for your leadership in the cause of a more progressive America.
cause;--;doc5.txt;--;standing up an army composed mainly of Shiites and Kurds will only cause the Sunnis to feel more threatened and fight even harder.
cause;--;doc2.txt;--;And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future.
viable;--;doc4.txt;--;Third, Kenya is hurt from factors unique to Africa's geography and place in the world -- disease, distance from viable markets and especially terms of trade.
viable;--;doc5.txt;--;If we commit our troops anywhere in the world, it is our solemn responsibility to define their mission and formulate a viable plan to fulfill that mission and bring our troops home.
independence;--;doc4.txt;--;There is no doubt that what Kenyans have accomplished with this independence is both impressive and inspiring.
independence;--;doc2.txt;--;Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient.
troop;--;doc5.txt;--;The redeployment could be temporarily suspended if the parties in Iraq reach an effective political arrangement that stabilizes the situation and they offer us a clear and compelling rationale for maintaining certain troop levels.
rebuilding;--;doc1.txt;--;Let us honor their valor by providing the care they need and rebuilding the military they love.
shut;--;doc1.txt;--;In the face of a politics that's shut you out, that's told you to settle, that's divided us for too long, you believe we can be one people, reaching for what's possible, building that more perfect union.
shut;--;doc2.txt;--;When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed.
belief;--;doc3.txt;--;Yes, our greatness as a nation has depended on individual initiative, on a belief in the free market.
belief;--;doc5.txt;--;The first is that we should be more modest in our belief that we can impose democracy on a country through military force.
belief;--;doc2.txt;--;That's the promise of America - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper.
easily;--;doc3.txt;--;No longer can we assume that a high-school education is enough to compete for a job that could easily go to a college-educated student in Bangalore or Beijing.
easily;--;doc5.txt;--;And on a trip to the former Soviet Union, I have seen the biological and nuclear weapons terrorists could easily steal while the world looks the other way.
cars;--;doc1.txt;--;We can harness homegrown, alternative fuels like ethanol and spur the production of more fuel-efficient cars.
cars;--;doc3.txt;--;The party that will harness homegrown, alternative fuels and spur the production of fuel-efficient, hybrid cars to break our dependence on the world's most dangerous regimes.
cars;--;doc2.txt;--;I'll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars.
million;--;doc6.txt;--;This is a city of two and a half million, and in a non-descript building right in the middle of town stood this facility that once operated on the fringes of the Soviet biological weapons program.
million;--;doc3.txt;--;I've had enough of the closed-door deals that give billions to the HMOs when we're told that we can't do a thing for the 45 million uninsured or the millions more who can't pay their medical bills.
million;--;doc2.txt;--;And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced.
threatened;--;doc4.txt;--;It is being threatened by corruption.
threatened;--;doc5.txt;--;standing up an army composed mainly of Shiites and Kurds will only cause the Sunnis to feel more threatened and fight even harder.
threatened;--;doc2.txt;--;We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more.
story;--;doc4.txt;--;The history of Africa is a history of ancient kingdoms and great traditions; the story of people fighting to be free from colonial rule; the heroism of not only of great men like Nkrumah and Kenyatta and Mandela, but also ordinary people who endured great hardship, from Ghana to South Africa, to secure self-determination in the face of great odds.
story;--;doc1.txt;--;It was here, in Springfield, where I saw all that is America converge - farmers and teachers, businessmen and laborers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamoring to be heard.
story;--;doc6.txt;--;And the Kiev story is heading in the right direction - while we were in Ukraine, Dick, through his tireless and personal intervention, was able to achieve a breakthrough with that government, bringing that facility and others under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program.
story;--;doc3.txt;--;Our time to write a new chapter in the American story.
story;--;doc2.txt;--;Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.
free;--;doc4.txt;--;You enjoy a robust civil society; a press that's free, fair, and honest; and a strong partnership with my own country that has resulted in critical cooperation on terrorist issues, real strides in fighting disease and poverty, and an important alliance on fostering regional stability.
free;--;doc1.txt;--;It is because of the millions who rallied to his cause that we are no longer divided, North and South, slave and free.
free;--;doc3.txt;--;Yes, our greatness as a nation has depended on individual initiative, on a belief in the free market.
free;--;doc5.txt;--;free markets, a free press, a strong civil society ?
free;--;doc2.txt;--;I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination.
insurgents;--;doc5.txt;--;An increase in the quality and quantity of U.S. personnel in training and advisory roles can guard against militia infiltration of Iraqi units; develop the trust and goodwill of Iraqi soldiers and the local populace; and lead to better intelligence while undercutting grassroots support for the insurgents.
reason;--;doc4.txt;--;And yet, the reason I speak of the freedom that you fought so hard to win is because today that freedom is in jeopardy.
reason;--;doc1.txt;--;We all made this journey for a reason.
reason;--;doc3.txt;--;The reason they don't believe government has a role in solving national problems is because they think government is the problem.
reason;--;doc5.txt;--;And, while some have proposed escalating this war by adding thousands of more troops, there is little reason to believe that this will achieve these results either.
reason;--;doc2.txt;--;The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight.
surely;--;doc4.txt;--;But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict.
surely;--;doc2.txt;--;I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination.
struggle;--;doc4.txt;--;And this is why the struggle against corruption is one of the great struggles of our time.
struggle;--;doc1.txt;--;But too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and the special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own.
struggle;--;doc5.txt;--;And it is time to refocus America’s efforts on the wider struggle yet to be won.
success;--;doc6.txt;--;Fortunately, the success of Cooperative Threat Reduction - especially in securing nuclear weapons - serves as a model of how we can do this.
success;--;doc5.txt;--;But we should know that our success in doing so is enhanced by engaging our allies so that we receive the crucial diplomatic, military, intelligence, and financial support that can lighten our load and add legitimacy to our actions.
success;--;doc2.txt;--;Yes, we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair.
fraud;--;doc4.txt;--;Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive.
fraud;--;doc5.txt;--;But instead of effectively targeting this aid, we have seen some of the largest waste, fraud, and abuse of foreign aid in American history.
put;--;doc4.txt;--;His ideas about how Kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years.
put;--;doc1.txt;--;In the face of Depression, we put people back to work and lifted millions out of poverty.
put;--;doc5.txt;--;We need to continue to provide some basic reconstruction funding that will be used to put Iraqis to work and help our troops stabilize key areas.
put;--;doc2.txt;--;We all put our country first.
obligation;--;doc4.txt;--;As a Senator from the United States, I believe that my country, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with Kenya and with Africa.
obligation;--;doc3.txt;--;That even though we may get involved out of civic obligation every few years, we don't always have confidence that government can make a difference in our lives.
obligation;--;doc2.txt;--;Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy.
care;--;doc4.txt;--;This means that the education and health care systems - issues that my own nation more than 200 years old still struggles with - lag behind, impacting its development.
care;--;doc1.txt;--;I want to win that next battle - for better schools, and better jobs, and health care for all.
care;--;doc3.txt;--;The party that won't just throw a few tax breaks at families who can't afford their insurance, but modernizes our health care system and gives every family a chance to buy insurance at a price they can afford.
care;--;doc5.txt;--;The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs recently said that if a conflict arose in North Korea, we’d have to largely rely on the Navy and Air Force to take care of it, since the Army and Marines are engaged elsewhere.
care;--;doc2.txt;--;Not with so many children to educate, and so many veterans to care for.
patronage;--;doc4.txt;--;Instead of opening businesses and engaging in commerce, people come to rely on patronage and payback as a means of advancing.
driven;--;doc5.txt;--;This force could help prevent the conflict in Iraq from becoming a wider war, consolidate gains in Northern Iraq, reassure allies in the Gulf, allow our troops to strike directly at al Qaeda wherever it may exist, and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region.
training;--;doc1.txt;--;Every single person willing to work should be able to get job training that leads to a job, and earn a living wage that can pay the bills, and afford child care so their kids have a safe place to go when they work.
training;--;doc3.txt;--;That in a global economy that's more connected and more competitive - we are the party that will guarantee every American an affordable, world-class, top-notch, life-long education - from early childhood to high school, from college to on-the-job training.
training;--;doc5.txt;--;An increase in the quality and quantity of U.S. personnel in training and advisory roles can guard against militia infiltration of Iraqi units; develop the trust and goodwill of Iraqi soldiers and the local populace; and lead to better intelligence while undercutting grassroots support for the insurgents.
benefits;--;doc1.txt;--;Let's protect the hard-earned benefits their companies have promised.
benefits;--;doc3.txt;--;I've had enough of being told that we can't afford body armor for our troops and health care for our veterans and benefits for the wounded heroes who've risked their lives for this country.
benefits;--;doc2.txt;--;Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers.
hostile;--;doc1.txt;--;As Lincoln organized the forces arrayed against slavery, he was heard to say: "Of strange, discordant, and even hostile elements, we gathered from the four winds, and formed and fought to battle through."
hostile;--;doc5.txt;--;Such a reduced but active presence will also send a clear message to hostile countries like Iran and Syria that we intend to remain a key player in this region.
could;--;doc4.txt;--;So if the government found ways to downsize the bureaucracy - to cut out the positions that aren't necessary or useful - it could use the extra money to increase the salary of other government officials.
could;--;doc3.txt;--;No longer can we assume that a high-school education is enough to compete for a job that could easily go to a college-educated student in Bangalore or Beijing.
could;--;doc5.txt;--;And on a trip to the former Soviet Union, I have seen the biological and nuclear weapons terrorists could easily steal while the world looks the other way.
could;--;doc2.txt;--;They could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred.
could;--;doc1.txt;--;Today we grieve for the families who have lost loved ones, the hearts that have been broken, and the young lives that could have been.
could;--;doc6.txt;--;One way we could strengthen this relationship is by thinking about the Russians as more of a partner and less of a subordinate in the Cooperative Threat Reduction effort.
computers;--;doc1.txt;--;I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill.
computers;--;doc3.txt;--;I've had enough of our kids going to schools where the rats outnumber the computers.

days;--;doc6.txt;--;With the situation in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union so drastically different than it was in 1991, or even in 1996 or 2001, what must we do to effectively confront this threat in the days and years to come?
days;--;doc5.txt;--;To reach such a solution, we must communicate clearly and effectively to the factions in Iraq that the days of asking, urging, and waiting for them to take control of their own country are coming to an end.
days;--;doc2.txt;--;For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face.
priorities;--;doc1.txt;--;That's why we'll have to set priorities.
honest;--;doc4.txt;--;And you will determine the direction of this country in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger Kenya where everyone rises together.
honest;--;doc3.txt;--;And let it be said that we are the party of open, honest government that doesn't peddle the agenda of whichever lobbyist or special interest can write the biggest check.
honest;--;doc2.txt;--;They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values.
turn;--;doc1.txt;--;But too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and the special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own.
turn;--;doc6.txt;--;I want to turn to a second critical area: biological weapons threat reduction programs.
turn;--;doc3.txt;--;And when she finally she saw hope breaking through the horizon in the Civil Rights Movement, she thought, "Maybe it's my turn."

american;--;doc1.txt;--;It's time to admit that no amount of American lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone else's civil war.

place;--;doc5.txt;--;There is one other place where our mistakes in Iraq have cost us dearly ?
place;--;doc2.txt;--;Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend.
place;--;doc1.txt;--;Every single person willing to work should be able to get job training that leads to a job, and earn a living wage that can pay the bills, and afford child care so their kids have a safe place to go when they work.
place;--;doc6.txt;--;Additionally, in the last few years, we've seen some disturbing trends from Russia itself - the deterioration of democracy and the rule of law, the abuses that have taken place in Chechnya, Russian meddling in the former Soviet Union - that raise serious questions about our relationship.

threat;--;doc6.txt;--;And we need to work together to obtain a bilateral agreement on biological threat reduction.
threat;--;doc5.txt;--;I said then and believe now that Saddam Hussein was a ruthless dictator who craved weapons of mass destruction but posed no imminent threat to the United States; that a war in Iraq would harm, not help, our efforts to defeat al Qaeda and finish the job in Afghanistan; and that an invasion would require an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences.

forging;--;doc5.txt;--;But we need to also move towards more condition-based aid packages where economic assistance is contingent upon the ability of Iraqis to make measurable progress on reducing sectarian violence and forging a lasting political settlement.
think;--;doc4.txt;--;I don't have all the solutions or think that they'll be easy, but there are a few places that a country truly committed to reform could start.
think;--;doc3.txt;--;Because I think that this is our moment to lead.
think;--;doc5.txt;--;We need to keep these lessons in mind as we think about the broader threats America now faces ?
think;--;doc2.txt;--;And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman.

railroads;--;doc3.txt;--;Four years after 9/11, I've had enough of being told that we can find the money to give Paris Hilton more tax cuts, but we can't find enough to protect our ports or our railroads or our chemical plants or our borders.
number;--;doc4.txt;--;I believe there a number of factors at work.
number;--;doc3.txt;--;That if you say the words "plan for victory" and point to the number of schools painted and roads paved and cell phones used in Iraq, no one will notice the nearly 2,500 flag-draped coffins that have arrived at Dover Air Force base.

americans;--;doc3.txt;--;Americans everywhere are desperate for leadership.
americans;--;doc5.txt;--;Americans called for this more serious policy a few Tuesdays ago.

petty;--;doc1.txt;--;What's stopped us is the failure of leadership, the smallness of our politics - the ease with which we're distracted by the petty and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough decisions, our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems.
petty;--;doc5.txt;--;a willingness on the part of each of us to look past what is petty and small and sensational, and look ahead to what is necessary and purposeful.

message;--;doc4.txt;--;The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels.
message;--;doc5.txt;--;I spoke here a year ago and delivered a message about Iraq that was similar to the one I did today.
accountability;--;doc4.txt;--;Wealth declarations do little good if no one can access them, and accountability in government spending is not possible if no one knows how much was available and allocated to a given project in the first place.
accountability;--;doc1.txt;--;Let's recruit a new army of teachers, and give them better pay and more support in exchange for more accountability.
accountability;--;doc2.txt;--;And in exchange, I'll ask for higher standards and more accountability.

open;--;doc6.txt;--;We entered through no fences or discernible security, and once we did, we found ourselves in a building with open first-floor windows and padlocks that many of us would not use to secure our own luggage.
open;--;doc3.txt;--;And let it be said that we are the party of open, honest government that doesn't peddle the agenda of whichever lobbyist or special interest can write the biggest check.

city;--;doc2.txt;--;We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes.
little;--;doc4.txt;--;I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see.
little;--;doc3.txt;--;She saw four little girls die in a Sunday school and catalyze a nation.
little;--;doc5.txt;--;And, while some have proposed escalating this war by adding thousands of more troops, there is little reason to believe that this will achieve these results either.
little;--;doc2.txt;--;We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma.
stifles;--;doc4.txt;--;It stifles innovation and fractures the fabric of the society.
officials;--;doc4.txt;--;So if the government found ways to downsize the bureaucracy - to cut out the positions that aren't necessary or useful - it could use the extra money to increase the salary of other government officials.
officials;--;doc6.txt;--;It's important for senior officials to go and visit these sites, to check their progress and shortcomings; to see what's working and what's not.
officials;--;doc5.txt;--;A year in which well-respected Republicans like John Warner, former Administration officials like Colin Powell, generals who have served in Iraq, and intelligence experts have all said that what we are doing is not working.

deadliest;--;doc6.txt;--;Of course, Dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs he co-founded with Senator Sam Nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former Soviet Union after the Cold War.
engagement;--;doc6.txt;--;And it means more sustained engagement, including more senior-level visits to Nunn-Lugar program sites.
engagement;--;doc5.txt;--;In each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the American people ?

interests;--;doc4.txt;--;And the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests.

relationship;--;doc6.txt;--;One way we could strengthen this relationship is by thinking about the Russians as more of a partner and less of a subordinate in the Cooperative Threat Reduction effort.
behind;--;doc4.txt;--;It's more than just history and outside influences that explain why Kenya lags behind.
behind;--;doc6.txt;--;But because of the size, secrecy, and scope of the Soviet biological weapons program, we are still dangerously behind in dealing with this proliferation threat.

took;--;doc1.txt;--;My work took me to some of Chicago's poorest neighborhoods.
took;--;doc5.txt;--;And this has been true for those of us who looked on the rubble and ashes of 9/11, and made a solemn pledge that such an atrocity would never again happen on United States soil; that we would do whatever it took to hunt down those responsible, and use every tool at our disposal ?
took;--;doc2.txt;--;And today, we import triple the amount of oil as the day that Senator McCain took office.

part;--;doc4.txt;--;By rejecting the insulting idea that corruption is somehow a part of Kenyan culture, these heroes reveal the very opposite - they reveal a strength and integrity of character that can build a great country, a great future.
part;--;doc1.txt;--;And I accepted the job, sight unseen, motivated then by a single, simple, powerful idea - that I might play a small part in building a better America.
part;--;doc6.txt;--;For my part, I would suggest three important elements that should be included in such a discussion.
part;--;doc5.txt;--;The third part of our strategy should be to link continued economic aid in Iraq with the existence of tangible progress toward a political settlement.
part;--;doc2.txt;--;This too is part of America's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort.
focusing;--;doc4.txt;--;By focusing on building strong, independent institutions - like an anti-corruption commission with real authority - rather than cults of personality, they make a contribution to their country that will last longer than their own lives.
focusing;--;doc1.txt;--;We can control costs by focusing on prevention, by providing better treatment to the chronically ill, and using technology to cut the bureaucracy.

believe;--;doc2.txt;--;I believe that as hard as it will be, the change we need is coming.
believe;--;doc1.txt;--;All of us running for president will travel around the country offering ten-point plans and making grand speeches; all of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead the country.

preacher;--;doc2.txt;--;"We cannot walk alone," the preacher cried.
kind;--;doc4.txt;--;Endemic corruption opens the door to this kind of movement, and in its wake comes a new set of distortions and betrayals of public trust.
kind;--;doc5.txt;--;This kind of realism has been missing since the very conception of this war, and it is what led me to publicly oppose it in 2002.
kind;--;doc2.txt;--;If you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves.
anxiety;--;doc1.txt;--;For the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight.
anxiety;--;doc3.txt;--;It's a time where you can go to any town hall or street corner or coffee shop and hear people express the same anxiety about the future; hear them convey the same uncertainty about the direction we're headed as a country.
anxiety;--;doc2.txt;--;And when one of his chief advisors - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a "mental recession," and that we've become, and I quote, "a nation of whiners."
effective;--;doc6.txt;--;Besides the devastation they can cause to a civilian population, biological agents can also be effective in asymmetrical warfare against U.S. troops.
effective;--;doc5.txt;--;The second part of our strategy should be to couple this phased redeployment with a more effective plan that puts the Iraqi security forces in the lead, intensifies and focuses our efforts to train those forces, and expands the numbers of our personnel ?

immigrants;--;doc3.txt;--;How she saw unions rise up and a middle-class prosper, and watched immigrants leave distant shores in search of an idea known as America.
immigrants;--;doc2.txt;--;It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot.
diplomatic;--;doc5.txt;--;But we should know that our success in doing so is enhanced by engaging our allies so that we receive the crucial diplomatic, military, intelligence, and financial support that can lighten our load and add legitimacy to our actions.
recruit;--;doc1.txt;--;Let's recruit a new army of teachers, and give them better pay and more support in exchange for more accountability.

recruit;--;doc5.txt;--;And a report by our own intelligence agencies has concluded that al Qaeda is successfully using the war in Iraq to recruit a new generation of terrorists for its war on America.
recruit;--;doc2.txt;--;I'll recruit an army of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries and give them more support.

matter;--;doc4.txt;--;And on a more personal level, because he never fully reconciled the traditions of his village with more modern conceptions of family - because he related to women as his father had, expecting them to obey him no matter what he did - his family life was unstable, and his children never knew him well.
matter;--;doc1.txt;--;For the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight.
matter;--;doc5.txt;--;In the absence of a genuine commitment on the part of all of the factions in Iraq to deal with this issue, it is doubtful that a unified Iraqi government can function for long, and it is doubtful that U.S. forces, no matter how large, can prevent an escalation of widespread sectarian killing.
future;--;doc4.txt;--;We have the opportunity to muster the courage to fulfill the promise of our forefathers and lead our great nations towards a better future.
future;--;doc1.txt;--;And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you.
future;--;doc6.txt;--;We all cherish our children's future.

members;--;doc2.txt;--;If you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves.
russia;--;doc6.txt;--;But when we think about the threat that these weapons pose to our global security, we cannot allow the U.S.-Russian relationship to deteriorate to the point where Russia does not think it's in their best interest to help us finish the job we started.

willingness;--;doc5.txt;--;a willingness on the part of each of us to look past what is petty and small and sensational, and look ahead to what is necessary and purposeful.
border;--;doc4.txt;--;Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive.
border;--;doc6.txt;--;As the Avian Influenza outbreak demonstrates, even the zealous Russian border guard is helpless against the global sweep of biological threats.
strengthen;--;doc4.txt;--;It is painfully obvious that corruption stifles development - it siphons off scarce resources that could improve infrastructure, bolster education systems, and strengthen public health.
strengthen;--;doc6.txt;--;One way we could strengthen this relationship is by thinking about the Russians as more of a partner and less of a subordinate in the Cooperative Threat Reduction effort.
pass;--;doc1.txt;--;But all of this cannot come to pass until we bring an end to this war in Iraq.
pass;--;doc5.txt;--;That policy-by-slogan will no longer pass as an acceptable form of debate in this country.
mind;--;doc4.txt;--;His ideas about how Kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years.
mind;--;doc1.txt;--;It was with these ideas in mind that I arrived in this capital city as a state Senator.
mind;--;doc5.txt;--;According to a Pew survey, 42% of Americans now agree with the statement that the U.S. should "mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own.”We cannot afford to be a country of isolationists right now.
mind;--;doc2.txt;--;Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.
tonight;--;doc3.txt;--;We are here tonight because we believe that in this country, we have it within our power to say "yes" to those questions - to forge our own destiny - to begin the world anew.
tonight;--;doc2.txt;--;But I stand before you tonight because all across America something is stirring.
talking;--;doc3.txt;--;We just didn't know he was talking about this one.
talking;--;doc5.txt;--;This means talking to our friends and, at times, even our enemies.
talking;--;doc2.txt;--;You don't protect Israel and deter Iran just by talking tough in Washington.
say;--;doc1.txt;--;As Lincoln organized the forces arrayed against slavery, he was heard to say: "Of strange, discordant, and even hostile elements, we gathered from the four winds, and formed and fought to battle through."
say;--;doc6.txt;--;But thinking of the Russians more as partners does mean being more thoughtful, respectful, and consistent about what we say and what we do.
say;--;doc3.txt;--;They can say that this was the time when America learned to dream again.
say;--;doc5.txt;--;I refuse to accept the possibility that I will have to come back a year from now and say the same thing.
say;--;doc2.txt;--;John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell - but he won't even go to the cave where he lives.
substantial;--;doc5.txt;--;But only if U.S. commanders think such a force would be effective; if there is substantial movement towards a political solution among Iraqi factions; if the Iraqi government showed a serious commitment to disbanding the militias; and if the Iraqi government asked us ?
close;--;doc1.txt;--;I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill.
close;--;doc2.txt;--;Not even close.
need;--;doc1.txt;--;Let us honor their valor by providing the care they need and rebuilding the military they love.
need;--;doc6.txt;--;And we need to work together to obtain a bilateral agreement on biological threat reduction.
need;--;doc3.txt;--;I don't need to sew to go to college.
need;--;doc5.txt;--;And so we need to maintain a strong foreign policy, relentless in pursuing our enemies and hopeful in promoting our values around the world.
need;--;doc2.txt;--;I believe that as hard as it will be, the change we need is coming.
seen;--;doc4.txt;--;Some of the worst actors on the international stage can also take advantage of the collective exhaustion and outrage that people feel with official corruption, as we've seen with Islamic extremists who promise purification, but deliver totalitarianism.
seen;--;doc6.txt;--;But lately we haven't seen many of these visits.
seen;--;doc3.txt;--;We've seen our children leave for Iraq and terrorists threaten to finish the job they started on 9/11.
seen;--;doc5.txt;--;And on a trip to the former Soviet Union, I have seen the biological and nuclear weapons terrorists could easily steal while the world looks the other way.
seen;--;doc2.txt;--;Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend.
seem;--;doc4.txt;--;I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see.
seem;--;doc3.txt;--;And the second thing people would ask me was, "You seem like a nice young man.
seem;--;doc2.txt;--;When Washington doesn't work, all its promises seem empty.
saw;--;doc1.txt;--;It was here, in Springfield, where I saw all that is America converge - farmers and teachers, businessmen and laborers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamoring to be heard.
saw;--;doc6.txt;--;I also saw their ability to ensure that shortcomings were addressed and programs were implemented correctly.

tells;--;doc3.txt;--;At one point, Kozol tells about his trip to Fremont High School in Los Angeles, where he met a girl who tells him that she'd taken hairdressing twice, because there were actually two different levels offered by the high school.

prosperity;--;doc1.txt;--;And as our economy changes, let's be the generation that ensures our nation's workers are sharing in our prosperity.
prosperity;--;doc2.txt;--;For over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy - give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else.
strength;--;doc4.txt;--;By rejecting the insulting idea that corruption is somehow a part of Kenyan culture, these heroes reveal the very opposite - they reveal a strength and integrity of character that can build a great country, a great future.
strength;--;doc3.txt;--;Let it be said that we will conduct a smart foreign policy that battles the forces of terrorism and fundamentalism wherever they may exist by matching the might of our military with the power of our diplomacy and the strength of our alliances.
strength;--;doc2.txt;--;This too is part of America's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort.

check;--;doc6.txt;--;It's important for senior officials to go and visit these sites, to check their progress and shortcomings; to see what's working and what's not.
check;--;doc3.txt;--;And let it be said that we are the party of open, honest government that doesn't peddle the agenda of whichever lobbyist or special interest can write the biggest check.
wages;--;doc1.txt;--;For the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight.
wages;--;doc2.txt;--;Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers.
responsible;--;doc5.txt;--;And this has been true for those of us who looked on the rubble and ashes of 9/11, and made a solemn pledge that such an atrocity would never again happen on United States soil; that we would do whatever it took to hunt down those responsible, and use every tool at our disposal ?
responsible;--;doc2.txt;--;That's the promise of America - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper.
able;--;doc1.txt;--;Every single person willing to work should be able to get job training that leads to a job, and earn a living wage that can pay the bills, and afford child care so their kids have a safe place to go when they work.
able;--;doc6.txt;--;And the Kiev story is heading in the right direction - while we were in Ukraine, Dick, through his tireless and personal intervention, was able to achieve a breakthrough with that government, bringing that facility and others under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program.
able;--;doc5.txt;--;And all the troops in the world won’t be able to force Shia, Sunni, and Kurd to sit down at a table, resolve their differences, and forge a lasting peace.
able;--;doc2.txt;--;If you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves.
ideas;--;doc4.txt;--;It stacks the deck so high against entrepreneurs that they cannot get their job-creating ideas off the ground.
ideas;--;doc1.txt;--;It was with these ideas in mind that I arrived in this capital city as a state Senator.
ideas;--;doc5.txt;--;What is absolutely clear is that it is not enough for the President to respond to Iraq’s reality by saying that he is “open to” or “interested in” new ideas while acting as if all that’s required is doing more of the same.
ideas;--;doc2.txt;--;Change happens because the American people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time.
ohio;--;doc2.txt;--;The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang-violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals.

solve;--;doc5.txt;--;Our troops can help suppress the violence, but they cannot solve its root causes.
solve;--;doc2.txt;--;Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology.

lugar;--;doc1.txt;--;I've worked with Republican Senator Dick Lugar to pass a law that will secure and destroy some of the world's deadliest, unguarded weapons.
lugar;--;doc6.txt;--;My third recommendation - which I'll just touch briefly on and let Senator Lugar talk about in more detail - is that we need to start thinking creatively about some of the next-generation efforts on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons.
memory;--;doc4.txt;--;I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see.
memory;--;doc1.txt;--;But too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and the special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own.

towards;--;doc5.txt;--;The goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of Iraq, prevent a further descent into civil war, and push the various Iraqi factions towards a political solution.
fundamental;--;doc5.txt;--;It is simply not productive for us not to engage in discussions with Iran and Syria on an issue of such fundamental importance to all of us.
fundamental;--;doc2.txt;--;That's the promise of America - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper.
combat;--;doc1.txt;--;That's why I have a plan that will bring our combat troops home by March of 2008.
combat;--;doc5.txt;--;We should also make it clear that, even after we begin to drawdown forces, we will still work with our allies in the region to combat international terrorism and prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction.
though;--;doc3.txt;--;That even though we may get involved out of civic obligation every few years, we don't always have confidence that government can make a difference in our lives.
though;--;doc5.txt;--;Rather, the question is what strategies, imperfect though they may be, are most likely to achieve the best outcome in Iraq, one that will ultimately put us on a more effective course to deal with international terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and other critical threats to our security.
quote;--;doc6.txt;--;But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at American University in 1963 about threats posed by the Soviet Union.
quote;--;doc2.txt;--;And when one of his chief advisors - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a "mental recession," and that we've become, and I quote, "a nation of whiners."
price;--;doc3.txt;--;The party that won't just throw a few tax breaks at families who can't afford their insurance, but modernizes our health care system and gives every family a chance to buy insurance at a price they can afford.
price;--;doc5.txt;--;Throughout American history, there have been moments that call on us to meet the challenges of an uncertain world, and pay whatever price is required to secure our freedom.
african;--;doc4.txt;--;It's not just a Kenyan problem, or an African problem.
reach;--;doc3.txt;--;She believed that over a span of three centuries, she had seen enough to know that there is no challenge too great, no injustice too crippling, no destiny too far out of reach for America.
reach;--;doc5.txt;--;The redeployment could be temporarily suspended if the parties in Iraq reach an effective political arrangement that stabilizes the situation and they offer us a clear and compelling rationale for maintaining certain troop levels.
reach;--;doc2.txt;--;It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot.
systems;--;doc4.txt;--;It is painfully obvious that corruption stifles development - it siphons off scarce resources that could improve infrastructure, bolster education systems, and strengthen public health.
paid;--;doc4.txt;--;Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive.
paid;--;doc3.txt;--;The party that's not bought and paid for by the oil companies.
paid;--;doc5.txt;--;threats we haven’t paid nearly enough attention to because we have been distracted in Iraq.
paid;--;doc2.txt;--;Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent.
eight;--;doc2.txt;--;For part of what has been lost these past eight years can't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits.
plan;--;doc1.txt;--;That's why I have a plan that will bring our combat troops home by March of 2008.
plan;--;doc3.txt;--;The party that won't make Americans choose between a health care plan that bankrupts the government and one that bankrupts families.
plan;--;doc5.txt;--;If we commit our troops anywhere in the world, it is our solemn responsibility to define their mission and formulate a viable plan to fulfill that mission and bring our troops home.
plan;--;doc2.txt;--;If you have health care, my plan will lower your premiums.
significant;--;doc5.txt;--;It’s not clear that these troop levels are sustainable for a significant period of time, and according to our commanders on the ground, adding American forces will only relieve the Iraqis from doing more on their own.
nothing;--;doc4.txt;--;And, as Frederick Douglass once stated: "Power concedes nothing without a demand.
nothing;--;doc5.txt;--;Today, the Iraqi landscape is littered with ill-conceived, half-finished projects that have done almost nothing to help the Iraqi people or stabilize the country.
nothing;--;doc2.txt;--;Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy.
grateful;--;doc2.txt;--;Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill.
america;--;doc4.txt;--;As I said at the outset, I did not know my father well - he returned to Kenya from America when I was still young.
america;--;doc1.txt;--;I want us to take up the unfinished business of perfecting our union, and building a better America.
america;--;doc3.txt;--;They can say that this was the time when America learned to dream again.
america;--;doc5.txt;--;We need to keep these lessons in mind as we think about the broader threats America now faces ?
america;--;doc2.txt;--;Thank you, and God Bless the United States of America.
alabama;--;doc3.txt;--;And she saw young people of every race and every creed take a bus down to Mississippi and Alabama to register voters because they believed.
destiny;--;doc1.txt;--;And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you.
destiny;--;doc3.txt;--;We are here tonight because we believe that in this country, we have it within our power to say "yes" to those questions - to forge our own destiny - to begin the world anew.
destiny;--;doc2.txt;--;But what the people heard instead - people of every creed and color, from every walk of life - is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked.
death;--;doc1.txt;--;And when all else fails, when Katrina happens, or the death toll in Iraq mounts, we've been told that our crises are somebody else's fault.
death;--;doc5.txt;--;“rejected the notion of an American ‘timeline’ for action on urgent Iraqi political issues; ordered American commanders to lift checkpoints they had set up around the Shiite district of Sadr City to hunt for a kidnapped American soldier and a fugitive Shiite death squad leader; and blamed the Americans for the deteriorating security situation in Iraq.”This is now the reality of Iraq.
demand;--;doc4.txt;--;And then there are anonymous Kenyan whistleblowers who show us what is, so that we can all work together to demand what should be.
demand;--;doc6.txt;--;But this is one story that shows our job is far from finished at a time when demand for these weapons has never been greater.
demand;--;doc2.txt;--;Change happens because the American people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time.
especially;--;doc4.txt;--;Third, Kenya is hurt from factors unique to Africa's geography and place in the world -- disease, distance from viable markets and especially terms of trade.
especially;--;doc6.txt;--;Fortunately, the success of Cooperative Threat Reduction - especially in securing nuclear weapons - serves as a model of how we can do this.
especially;--;doc5.txt;--;especially freedom from want and freedom from fear ?
especially;--;doc2.txt;--;Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest - a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours -- Hillary Rodham Clinton.
consequences;--;doc6.txt;--;For a scientist or other employee to simply walk out of the lab with enough material to construct a weapon of mass destruction is far too easy, and the consequences would be far too devastating.
consequences;--;doc5.txt;--;The President’s decision to go to war in Iraq has had disastrous consequences for Afghanistan -- we have seen a fierce Taliban offensive, a spike in terrorist attacks, and a narcotrafficking problem spiral out of control.
sweeping;--;doc1.txt;--;I was proud to help lead the fight in Congress that led to the most sweeping ethics reform since Watergate.
sweeping;--;doc3.txt;--;The sweeping changes brought by revolutions in technology have torn down walls between business and government and people and places all over the globe.
clear;--;doc4.txt;--;And the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests.
clear;--;doc6.txt;--;Now, few people understand these challenges better than the co-founder of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, Dick Lugar, and this is something that became particularly clear to me during one incident on the trip.
clear;--;doc5.txt;--;But even as we provide such help, we should be clear that the institutions of democracy ?
clear;--;doc2.txt;--;As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home.
proud;--;doc1.txt;--;Let's be the generation that makes future generations proud of what we did here.
proud;--;doc3.txt;--;Because in the end, we may be proud Democrats, but we are prouder Americans.
proud;--;doc2.txt;--;The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag.
sisters;--;doc4.txt;--;In addition, we know that the more information the public is provided, the easier it will be for your Kenyan brothers and sisters out in the villages to evaluate whether they are being treated fairly by their public servants or not.
sisters;--;doc2.txt;--;I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination.
disease;--;doc4.txt;--;You enjoy a robust civil society; a press that's free, fair, and honest; and a strong partnership with my own country that has resulted in critical cooperation on terrorist issues, real strides in fighting disease and poverty, and an important alliance on fostering regional stability.
disease;--;doc6.txt;--;Additional steps should also be taken to consolidate and secure dangerous pathogen collections, strengthen bio-reconnaissance networks to provide early warning of bio-attack and natural disease outbreaks, and have our experts work together to develop improved medical countermeasures.
disease;--;doc2.txt;--;I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease.
face;--;doc4.txt;--;The history of Africa is a history of ancient kingdoms and great traditions; the story of people fighting to be free from colonial rule; the heroism of not only of great men like Nkrumah and Kenyatta and Mandela, but also ordinary people who endured great hardship, from Ghana to South Africa, to secure self-determination in the face of great odds.
face;--;doc1.txt;--;It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people - as Americans.
face;--;doc3.txt;--;And I think that we face one of those moments today.
face;--;doc5.txt;--;the American people have determined that all these phrases have become meaningless in the face of a conflict that grows more deadly and chaotic with each passing day ?
face;--;doc2.txt;--;The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past.
looked;--;doc1.txt;--;And as people have looked away in disillusionment and frustration, we know what's filled the void.
looked;--;doc6.txt;--;He looked at me and said, "Been there, done that."
looked;--;doc3.txt;--;And she knew that during those moments in history where it looked like we might give up hope or settle for less, there have always been Americans who refused.
looked;--;doc5.txt;--;And this has been true for those of us who looked on the rubble and ashes of 9/11, and made a solemn pledge that such an atrocity would never again happen on United States soil; that we would do whatever it took to hunt down those responsible, and use every tool at our disposal ?
solemn;--;doc5.txt;--;If we commit our troops anywhere in the world, it is our solemn responsibility to define their mission and formulate a viable plan to fulfill that mission and bring our troops home.
points;--;doc1.txt;--;What's stopped us is the failure of leadership, the smallness of our politics - the ease with which we're distracted by the petty and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough decisions, our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems.
points;--;doc5.txt;--;This brings me to a set of broader points.
sources;--;doc6.txt;--;In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose.
sources;--;doc2.txt;--;And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced.
clean;--;doc2.txt;--;As President, I will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology, and find ways to safely harness nuclear power.
laid;--;doc1.txt;--;It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people - as Americans.
laid;--;doc2.txt;--;Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime - by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow.
link;--;doc6.txt;--;"Let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved...For in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet.
link;--;doc5.txt;--;The third part of our strategy should be to link continued economic aid in Iraq with the existence of tangible progress toward a political settlement.
left;--;doc4.txt;--;I discovered the beauty of the land, a beauty that haunts you long after you've left.
left;--;doc1.txt;--;But too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and the special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own.
left;--;doc6.txt;--;Of course, Dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs he co-founded with Senator Sam Nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former Soviet Union after the Cold War.
left;--;doc5.txt;--;For the fact is that there are no good options left in this war.
tubes;--;doc6.txt;--;Some of the tubes, he said, were filled with anthrax.
institutions;--;doc4.txt;--;By focusing on building strong, independent institutions - like an anti-corruption commission with real authority - rather than cults of personality, they make a contribution to their country that will last longer than their own lives.
institutions;--;doc5.txt;--;But even as we provide such help, we should be clear that the institutions of democracy ?
came;--;doc4.txt;--;This is the Kenya that so many who came before you envisioned - all those men and women who struggled and sacrificed and fought for the freedom you enjoy today.
came;--;doc1.txt;--;It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America.
came;--;doc5.txt;--;When I came here and gave a speech on this war a year ago, I suggested that we begin to move towards a phased redeployment of American troops from Iraqi soil.
laws;--;doc4.txt;--;And the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests.
laws;--;doc2.txt;--;Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the time to protect Social Security for future generations.
desperately;--;doc4.txt;--;In today's Kenya - a Kenya already more open and less repressive than in my father's day - it is that courage that will bring the reform so many of you so desperately want and deserve.
saying;--;doc1.txt;--;Let me begin by saying thanks to all you who've traveled, from far and wide, to brave the cold today.
saying;--;doc6.txt;--;She picked them up, clanked them around, and we listened to the translator explain what she was saying.
saying;--;doc5.txt;--;What is absolutely clear is that it is not enough for the President to respond to Iraq’s reality by saying that he is “open to” or “interested in” new ideas while acting as if all that’s required is doing more of the same.
warfare;--;doc6.txt;--;Besides the devastation they can cause to a civilian population, biological agents can also be effective in asymmetrical warfare against U.S. troops.
unified;--;doc1.txt;--;In the face of secession, we unified a nation and set the captives free.
unified;--;doc5.txt;--;In the absence of a genuine commitment on the part of all of the factions in Iraq to deal with this issue, it is doubtful that a unified Iraqi government can function for long, and it is doubtful that U.S. forces, no matter how large, can prevent an escalation of widespread sectarian killing.
lewis;--;doc3.txt;--;And I've wondered - if she is lucky enough to live as long as 105-year-old Marguerite Lewis, if she someday has the chance to look back across the twenty-first century, what will she see?
sent;--;doc6.txt;--;Here in Washington, we saw what happened when just two letters filled with just a few grams of Anthrax were sent to the U.S. Senate.
sent;--;doc5.txt;--;And now, after three long years of watching the same back and forth in Washington, the American people have sent a clear message that the days of using the war on terror as a political football are over.
unseen;--;doc1.txt;--;And I accepted the job, sight unseen, motivated then by a single, simple, powerful idea - that I might play a small part in building a better America.
unseen;--;doc2.txt;--;Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend.
bin;--;doc2.txt;--;John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell - but he won't even go to the cave where he lives.
discovered;--;doc4.txt;--;And yet, I discovered that for all his education, my father's life ended up being filled with disappointments.
bring;--;doc4.txt;--;In today's Kenya - a Kenya already more open and less repressive than in my father's day - it is that courage that will bring the reform so many of you so desperately want and deserve.
bring;--;doc1.txt;--;That's why I have a plan that will bring our combat troops home by March of 2008.
bring;--;doc6.txt;--;In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose.
bring;--;doc3.txt;--;Because we've always fought to bring all of our people under the blanket of the American Dream.
bring;--;doc5.txt;--;If we commit our troops anywhere in the world, it is our solemn responsibility to define their mission and formulate a viable plan to fulfill that mission and bring our troops home.
qaeda;--;doc6.txt;--;And as we speak, members of Al Qaeda and other terrorists organizations are aggressively pursuing weapons of mass destruction, which they would use without hesitation.
qaeda;--;doc5.txt;--;In my travels to Africa, I have seen weak governments and broken societies that can be exploited by al Qaeda.
qaeda;--;doc2.txt;--;I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan.
businesses;--;doc4.txt;--;Instead of opening businesses and engaging in commerce, people come to rely on patronage and payback as a means of advancing.
businesses;--;doc1.txt;--;We can turn this crisis of global warming into a moment of opportunity for innovation, and job creation, and an incentive for businesses that will serve as a model for the world.
businesses;--;doc2.txt;--;Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient.
democrats;--;doc3.txt;--;Because in the end, we may be proud Democrats, but we are prouder Americans.
democrats;--;doc2.txt;--;The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past.
soldiers;--;doc5.txt;--;We can teach the soldiers to fight and police to patrol, but if the Iraqi government will not properly feed, adequately pay, or provide them with the equipment they need, they will continue to desert in large numbers, or maintain fealty only to their religious group rather than the national government.
soldiers;--;doc2.txt;--;I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise.
fear;--;doc4.txt;--;What's worse - corruption can also provide opportunities for those who would harness the fear and hatred of others to their agenda and ambitions.
fear;--;doc1.txt;--;And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you.
fear;--;doc3.txt;--;And how she watched FDR lift this nation out of fear and send millions to college on the GI Bill and lift millions out of poverty with Social Security.
fear;--;doc5.txt;--;especially freedom from want and freedom from fear ?
fear;--;doc2.txt;--;They could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred.
tuesdays;--;doc5.txt;--;Americans called for this more serious policy a few Tuesdays ago.
find;--;doc4.txt;--;Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive.
find;--;doc3.txt;--;Four years after 9/11, I've had enough of being told that we can find the money to give Paris Hilton more tax cuts, but we can't find enough to protect our ports or our railroads or our chemical plants or our borders.
find;--;doc5.txt;--;Much has been written about how the military invasion of Iraq was planned without any thought to what political situation we would find after Baghdad fell.
find;--;doc2.txt;--;This too is part of America's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort.
find;--;doc1.txt;--;Letting the Iraqis know that we will not be there forever is our last, best hope to pressure the Sunni and Shia to come to the table and find peace.
find;--;doc6.txt;--;Some weapons experts believe that terrorists are likely to find enough fissile material to build a bomb in the next ten years - and we can imagine with horror what the world will be like if they succeed.
ground;--;doc4.txt;--;It stacks the deck so high against entrepreneurs that they cannot get their job-creating ideas off the ground.
ground;--;doc5.txt;--;We cannot compromise the safety of our troops, and we should be willing to adjust to realities on the ground.
lessons;--;doc5.txt;--;We need to keep these lessons in mind as we think about the broader threats America now faces ?
partners;--;doc4.txt;--;As a Senator from the United States, I believe that my country, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with Kenya and with Africa.
partners;--;doc6.txt;--;But thinking of the Russians more as partners does mean being more thoughtful, respectful, and consistent about what we say and what we do.
speeches;--;doc1.txt;--;All of us running for president will travel around the country offering ten-point plans and making grand speeches; all of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead the country.
speeches;--;doc5.txt;--;There have been too many speeches.
provided;--;doc4.txt;--;In addition, we know that the more information the public is provided, the easier it will be for your Kenyan brothers and sisters out in the villages to evaluate whether they are being treated fairly by their public servants or not.
provided;--;doc2.txt;--;I've seen it in Illinois, when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work.
based;--;doc5.txt;--;a policy based on blind hope and ideology instead of fact and reality.
depended;--;doc3.txt;--;But it has also depended on our sense of mutual regard for each other, of mutual responsibility.
securing;--;doc6.txt;--;Fortunately, the success of Cooperative Threat Reduction - especially in securing nuclear weapons - serves as a model of how we can do this.
securing;--;doc5.txt;--;The addition of 4,000 American troops in Baghdad has not succeeded in securing that increasingly perilous city.
justice;--;doc4.txt;--;It can shield a war criminal - even one like Felicien Kabuga, suspected of helping to finance and orchestrate the Rwandan genocide - by allowing him to purchase safe haven for a time and robbing all humanity of the opportunity to bring the criminal to justice.
justice;--;doc1.txt;--;I want to win that next battle - for justice and opportunity.
explain;--;doc4.txt;--;It's more than just history and outside influences that explain why Kenya lags behind.
explain;--;doc6.txt;--;She picked them up, clanked them around, and we listened to the translator explain what she was saying.
explain;--;doc3.txt;--;And I'd have to explain that I got the name from my father, who was from Kenya.
dick;--;doc1.txt;--;I've worked with Republican Senator Dick Lugar to pass a law that will secure and destroy some of the world's deadliest, unguarded weapons.
dick;--;doc6.txt;--;And the Kiev story is heading in the right direction - while we were in Ukraine, Dick, through his tireless and personal intervention, was able to achieve a breakthrough with that government, bringing that facility and others under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program.
dick;--;doc2.txt;--;Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third.
hopeful;--;doc1.txt;--;It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America.
hopeful;--;doc5.txt;--;And so we need to maintain a strong foreign policy, relentless in pursuing our enemies and hopeful in promoting our values around the world.
state;--;doc4.txt;--;And corruption also erodes the state from the inside out, sickening the justice system until there is no justice to be found, poisoning the police forces until their presence becomes a source of insecurity rather than comfort.
state;--;doc1.txt;--;And that is why, in the shadow of the Old State Capitol, where Lincoln once called on a divided house to stand together, where common hopes and common dreams still, I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for President of the United States.
state;--;doc3.txt;--;I remember when I first ran for the state Senate - my very first race.
state;--;doc5.txt;--;We would make clear in such a scenario that the United States would not be maintaining permanent military bases in Iraq, but would do what was necessary to help prevent a total collapse of the Iraqi state and further polarization of Iraqi society.
alternative;--;doc1.txt;--;We can harness homegrown, alternative fuels like ethanol and spur the production of more fuel-efficient cars.
alternative;--;doc3.txt;--;The party that will harness homegrown, alternative fuels and spur the production of fuel-efficient, hybrid cars to break our dependence on the world's most dangerous regimes.
accelerate;--;doc6.txt;--;Everyone has a role to play, and everyone must accelerate this involvement.
held;--;doc4.txt;--;You will decide if your leaders will be held accountable, or if you will look the other way.
held;--;doc3.txt;--;We had held a large rally the night before in the Southside of Chicago, which is where I live.
held;--;doc5.txt;--;making the hard choices and sacrifices necessary to uphold our most deeply held values and ideals.
bush;--;doc3.txt;--;Now, let me say this - I don't think that George Bush is a bad man.
bush;--;doc2.txt;--;If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need.
going;--;doc3.txt;--;I've had enough of our kids going to schools where the rats outnumber the computers.
going;--;doc5.txt;--;And so going forward, I believe there are strategic lessons to be learned from this as we continue to confront the new threats of this new century.
going;--;doc2.txt;--;Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans.
churches;--;doc1.txt;--;But a group of churches had offered me a job as a community organizer for $13,000 a year.
churches;--;doc3.txt;--;We know that we've been called in churches and mosques, synagogues and Sunday schools to love our neighbors as ourselves; to be our brother's keeper; to be our sister's keeper.
pursuing;--;doc6.txt;--;And as we speak, members of Al Qaeda and other terrorists organizations are aggressively pursuing weapons of mass destruction, which they would use without hesitation.
pursuing;--;doc5.txt;--;And so we need to maintain a strong foreign policy, relentless in pursuing our enemies and hopeful in promoting our values around the world.
candidates;--;doc1.txt;--;After all, every four years, candidates from both parties make similar promises, and I expect this year will be no different.
candidates;--;doc2.txt;--;Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest - a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours -- Hillary Rodham Clinton.

announce;--;doc5.txt;--;The President should announce to the Iraqi people that our policy will include a gradual and substantial reduction in U.S. forces.

watching;--;doc2.txt;--;And although she can no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well.
local;--;doc4.txt;--;In fact, one recent survey showed that corruption in Kenya costs local firms 6% of their revenues, the difference between good-paying jobs in Kenya or somewhere else.
local;--;doc1.txt;--;I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill.
local;--;doc5.txt;--;An increase in the quality and quantity of U.S. personnel in training and advisory roles can guard against militia infiltration of Iraqi units; develop the trust and goodwill of Iraqi soldiers and the local populace; and lead to better intelligence while undercutting grassroots support for the insurgents.

get;--;doc4.txt;--;As well as numerous Kenyan men and women who have refused to pay bribes to get civil servants to perform their duties; the auditors and inspectors general who have done the job before them accurately and fairly, regardless of where the facts have led; the journalists who asked questions and pushed for answers when it may have been more lucrative to look the other way, or whip up a convenient fiction.
get;--;doc3.txt;--;And then someday, someday, if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the 21st century, they can say that this was the time when America renewed its purpose.

get;--;doc2.txt;--;I get it.
get;--;doc1.txt;--;Finally, there is one other thing that is not too late to get right about this war - and that is the homecoming of the men and women - our veterans - who have sacrificed the most.
get;--;doc6.txt;--;Much of what President Kennedy described in 1963 remains true to this day - and we owe it to ourselves and our children to get it right.
succeeded;--;doc4.txt;--;This coalition succeeded by promising change, and their early gestures - the dismissal of the shaky judges, the renewed vigor of the investigation into the Goldenberg scandal, the calls for real disclosure of elected officials' personal wealth - were all promising.
succeeded;--;doc5.txt;--;The addition of 4,000 American troops in Baghdad has not succeeded in securing that increasingly perilous city.
express;--;doc3.txt;--;It's a time where you can go to any town hall or street corner or coffee shop and hear people express the same anxiety about the future; hear them convey the same uncertainty about the direction we're headed as a country.
express;--;doc2.txt;--;Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest - a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours -- Hillary Rodham Clinton.
stop;--;doc4.txt;--;Finally, ethnic-based tribal politics has to stop.
stop;--;doc6.txt;--;Right now, there are forces within the former Soviet Union and elsewhere that want these non-proliferation programs to stop.
stop;--;doc5.txt;--;namely, preventing Iraq from becoming what Afghanistan once was, maintaining our influence in the Middle East, and forging a political settlement to stop the sectarian violence so that our troops can come home.
stop;--;doc2.txt;--;If your hopes have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop hoping, and settle for what you already know.
lucky;--;doc3.txt;--;And I've wondered - if she is lucky enough to live as long as 105-year-old Marguerite Lewis, if she someday has the chance to look back across the twenty-first century, what will she see?

baghdad;--;doc5.txt;--;Much has been written about how the military invasion of Iraq was planned without any thought to what political situation we would find after Baghdad fell.

courage;--;doc2.txt;--;Because for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women - students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors -- found the courage to keep it alive.
competitive;--;doc1.txt;--;Each of us, in our own lives, will have to accept responsibility - for instilling an ethic of achievement in our children, for adapting to a more competitive economy, for strengthening our communities, and sharing some measure of sacrifice.

words;--;doc3.txt;--;He was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the Republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the Democrats should come down to just two words:Had enough?
words;--;doc2.txt;--;Let us keep that promise - that American promise - and in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess.
international;--;doc4.txt;--;Some of the worst actors on the international stage can also take advantage of the collective exhaustion and outrage that people feel with official corruption, as we've seen with Islamic extremists who promise purification, but deliver totalitarianism.

suggest;--;doc6.txt;--;For my part, I would suggest three important elements that should be included in such a discussion.
suggest;--;doc2.txt;--;But what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes.
trade;--;doc4.txt;--;Third, Kenya is hurt from factors unique to Africa's geography and place in the world -- disease, distance from viable markets and especially terms of trade.
trade;--;doc2.txt;--;For part of what has been lost these past eight years can't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits.
kozol;--;doc3.txt;--;At one point, Kozol tells about his trip to Fremont High School in Los Angeles, where he met a girl who tells him that she'd taken hairdressing twice, because there were actually two different levels offered by the high school.
bigger;--;doc4.txt;--;I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see.
bigger;--;doc2.txt;--;For part of what has been lost these past eight years can't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits.
reveal;--;doc4.txt;--;By rejecting the insulting idea that corruption is somehow a part of Kenyan culture, these heroes reveal the very opposite - they reveal a strength and integrity of character that can build a great country, a great future.
resolve;--;doc4.txt;--;Clarifying these rules and focusing resources on building a judicial system that can enforce them and resolve disputes should be a primary goal of any government suffering from corruption.
resolve;--;doc1.txt;--;It's time to admit that no amount of American lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone else's civil war.
resolve;--;doc5.txt;--;And all the troops in the world won’t be able to force Shia, Sunni, and Kurd to sit down at a table, resolve their differences, and forge a lasting peace.
roles;--;doc5.txt;--;An increase in the quality and quantity of U.S. personnel in training and advisory roles can guard against militia infiltration of Iraqi units; develop the trust and goodwill of Iraqi soldiers and the local populace; and lead to better intelligence while undercutting grassroots support for the insurgents.

countries;--;doc5.txt;--;According to a Pew survey, 42% of Americans now agree with the statement that the U.S. should "mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own.”We cannot afford to be a country of isolationists right now.
countries;--;doc2.txt;--;You don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty countries by occupying Iraq.
deterioration;--;doc6.txt;--;Additionally, in the last few years, we've seen some disturbing trends from Russia itself - the deterioration of democracy and the rule of law, the abuses that have taken place in Chechnya, Russian meddling in the former Soviet Union - that raise serious questions about our relationship.
deterioration;--;doc5.txt;--;Perhaps most importantly, some of these troops could be redeployed to Afghanistan, where our lack of focus and commitment of resources has led to an increasing deterioration of the security situation there.
middle-class;--;doc1.txt;--;And let's allow our unions and their organizers to lift up this country's middle-class again.
middle-class;--;doc3.txt;--;In a century just six years old, our faith has been shaken by war and terror, disaster and despair, threats to the middle-class dream, and scandal and corruption in our government.
middle-class;--;doc2.txt;--;Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class.
taxes;--;doc2.txt;--;They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values.
corruption;--;doc4.txt;--;By rejecting the insulting idea that corruption is somehow a part of Kenyan culture, these heroes reveal the very opposite - they reveal a strength and integrity of character that can build a great country, a great future.
corruption;--;doc3.txt;--;In a century just six years old, our faith has been shaken by war and terror, disaster and despair, threats to the middle-class dream, and scandal and corruption in our government.
sacrifices;--;doc4.txt;--;Certainly it is not due to lack of effort on the part of ordinary Kenyans - we know how hard Kenyans are willing to work, the tremendous sacrifices that Kenyan mothers make for their children, the Herculean efforts that Kenyan fathers make for their families.
sacrifices;--;doc5.txt;--;making the hard choices and sacrifices necessary to uphold our most deeply held values and ideals.
bad;--;doc3.txt;--;Now, let me say this - I don't think that George Bush is a bad man.
bad;--;doc5.txt;--;No matter how bad it gets, we are told to wait, and not ask questions.
bad;--;doc2.txt;--;If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need.
common;--;doc4.txt;--;In the end, if the people cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost.
common;--;doc1.txt;--;This campaign has to be about reclaiming the meaning of citizenship, restoring our sense of common purpose, and realizing that few obstacles can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change.
common;--;doc6.txt;--;"Let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved...For in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet.
common;--;doc2.txt;--;This too is part of America's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort.
korea;--;doc4.txt;--;Today, South Korea's economy is forty times larger than Kenya's.
korea;--;doc5.txt;--;The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs recently said that if a conflict arose in North Korea, we’d have to largely rely on the Navy and Air Force to take care of it, since the Army and Marines are engaged elsewhere.
including;--;doc6.txt;--;And it means more sustained engagement, including more senior-level visits to Nunn-Lugar program sites.
including;--;doc5.txt;--;Senators, Republican and Democrat, including myself, had also voted in favor of a resolution demanding that 2006 be a year of significant transition in Iraq.
movement;--;doc4.txt;--;Endemic corruption opens the door to this kind of movement, and in its wake comes a new set of distortions and betrayals of public trust.
movement;--;doc3.txt;--;And in that movement, she saw women who were willing to walk instead of ride the bus after a day of doing somebody else's laundry and looking after somebody else's children because they walked for freedom.
movement;--;doc5.txt;--;But only if U.S. commanders think such a force would be effective; if there is substantial movement towards a political solution among Iraqi factions; if the Iraqi government showed a serious commitment to disbanding the militias; and if the Iraqi government asked us ?
generations;--;doc1.txt;--;And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you.
generations;--;doc2.txt;--;The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans -- Democrats and Republicans - have built, and we are here to restore that legacy.
respond;--;doc4.txt;--;It makes it impossible to respond effectively to crises -- whether it's the HIV/AIDS pandemic or malaria or crippling drought.
respond;--;doc5.txt;--;As a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the U.S. troops remaining in Iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and American enclaves like the Green Zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists.
respond;--;doc2.txt;--;But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W. Bush.
available;--;doc4.txt;--;When people are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the country, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups.
set;--;doc4.txt;--;And the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests.
set;--;doc1.txt;--;We can set up a system for capping greenhouse gases.
set;--;doc5.txt;--;This brings me to a set of broader points.
set;--;doc2.txt;--;And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East.
patriotism;--;doc2.txt;--;So let us agree that patriotism has no party.
disaster;--;doc3.txt;--;In a century just six years old, our faith has been shaken by war and terror, disaster and despair, threats to the middle-class dream, and scandal and corruption in our government.
disaster;--;doc2.txt;--;This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work.
fair;--;doc4.txt;--;You enjoy a robust civil society; a press that's free, fair, and honest; and a strong partnership with my own country that has resulted in critical cooperation on terrorist issues, real strides in fighting disease and poverty, and an important alliance on fostering regional stability.
fair;--;doc1.txt;--;That's why we made the tax system more fair and just for working families, and that's why we passed ethics reforms that the cynics said could never, ever be passed.
fair;--;doc3.txt;--;It allows us to say to those whose health care or tuition may rise faster than they can afford - life isn't fair.
frustration;--;doc4.txt;--;The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels.
frustration;--;doc1.txt;--;And as people have looked away in disillusionment and frustration, we know what's filled the void.
frustration;--;doc2.txt;--;They could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred.
intelligence;--;doc4.txt;--;We know as well the talent, the intelligence, and the creativity that exists in this country.
intelligence;--;doc1.txt;--;We can work together to track terrorists down with a stronger military, we can tighten the net around their finances, and we can improve our intelligence capabilities.
intelligence;--;doc5.txt;--;The overwhelming presence of our troops, our intelligence, and our resources in Iraq has stretched our military to the breaking point and distracted us from the growing threats of a dangerous world.
national;--;doc4.txt;--;It suffers from the legacy of colonialism, of national boundaries that were drawn without regard to the political and tribal alignments of indigenous peoples, and that therefore fed conflict and tribal strife.
national;--;doc6.txt;--;This does not mean that we should ease up one bit on issues affecting our national security.
national;--;doc3.txt;--;The reason they don't believe government has a role in solving national problems is because they think government is the problem.
national;--;doc5.txt;--;The National Intelligence Estimate, which details how we’re creating more terrorists in Iraq than we’re defeating, is the most obvious example of how the war is hurting our efforts in the larger battle against terrorism.
committed;--;doc4.txt;--;I don't have all the solutions or think that they'll be easy, but there are a few places that a country truly committed to reform could start.
committed;--;doc5.txt;--;I am committed to working with this White House and any of my colleagues in the months to come to craft such a consensus.
globe;--;doc1.txt;--;But let us also understand that ultimate victory against our enemies will come only by rebuilding our alliances and exporting those ideals that bring hope and opportunity to millions around the globe.
globe;--;doc3.txt;--;The sweeping changes brought by revolutions in technology have torn down walls between business and government and people and places all over the globe.
seat;--;doc1.txt;--;It was here, in Springfield, where I saw all that is America converge - farmers and teachers, businessmen and laborers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamoring to be heard.
seat;--;doc3.txt;--;A seat had opened up, and some friends asked me if I'd be interested in running.
connections;--;doc4.txt;--;When people are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the country, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups.
connections;--;doc1.txt;--;I was a young man then, just a year out of college; I knew no one in Chicago, was without money or family connections.
culture;--;doc4.txt;--;By rejecting the insulting idea that corruption is somehow a part of Kenyan culture, these heroes reveal the very opposite - they reveal a strength and integrity of character that can build a great country, a great future.
culture;--;doc2.txt;--;Our universities and our culture are the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores.
see;--;doc4.txt;--;I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see.
see;--;doc3.txt;--;Will she see greater opportunities for every citizen of this country?
see;--;doc5.txt;--;But neither Iran nor Syria want to see a security vacuum in Iraq filled with chaos, terrorism, refugees, and violence, as it could have a destabilizing effect throughout the entire region ?
see;--;doc2.txt;--;I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise.
see;--;doc1.txt;--;And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you.
see;--;doc6.txt;--;We need to see more.
individual;--;doc3.txt;--;That we have individual responsibility, but we also have collective responsibility to each other.
individual;--;doc2.txt;--;Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility - that's the essence of America's promise.
college;--;doc1.txt;--;Let's make college more affordable, and let's invest in scientific research, and let's lay down broadband lines through the heart of inner cities and rural towns all across America.
college;--;doc3.txt;--;I don't need to sew to go to college.
college;--;doc2.txt;--;And we will keep our promise to every young American - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education.
result;--;doc4.txt;--;As a result, many African nations have been asked to liberalize their markets without reciprocal concessions from mature economies.
result;--;doc3.txt;--;And as a result, we've seen families work harder for less and our jobs go overseas.
result;--;doc2.txt;--;You understand that in this election, the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result.
fail;--;doc1.txt;--;Divided, we are bound to fail.
fail;--;doc5.txt;--;We know these countries want us to fail, and we should remain steadfast in our opposition to their support of terrorism and Iran’s nuclear ambitions.
led;--;doc4.txt;--;As well as numerous Kenyan men and women who have refused to pay bribes to get civil servants to perform their duties; the auditors and inspectors general who have done the job before them accurately and fairly, regardless of where the facts have led; the journalists who asked questions and pushed for answers when it may have been more lucrative to look the other way, or whip up a convenient fiction.
led;--;doc1.txt;--;I was proud to help lead the fight in Congress that led to the most sweeping ethics reform since Watergate.

best;--;doc1.txt;--;Letting the Iraqis know that we will not be there forever is our last, best hope to pressure the Sunni and Shia to come to the table and find peace.
best;--;doc6.txt;--;But when we think about the threat that these weapons pose to our global security, we cannot allow the U.S.-Russian relationship to deteriorate to the point where Russia does not think it's in their best interest to help us finish the job we started.
best;--;doc5.txt;--;According to a Pew survey, 42% of Americans now agree with the statement that the U.S. should "mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own.”We cannot afford to be a country of isolationists right now.

said;--;doc5.txt;--;The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs recently said that if a conflict arose in North Korea, we’d have to largely rely on the Navy and Air Force to take care of it, since the Army and Marines are engaged elsewhere.
said;--;doc2.txt;--;For eighteen long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past.

said;--;doc6.txt;--;He looked at me and said, "Been there, done that."
threats;--;doc6.txt;--;But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at American University in 1963 about threats posed by the Soviet Union.
threats;--;doc3.txt;--;In a century just six years old, our faith has been shaken by war and terror, disaster and despair, threats to the middle-class dream, and scandal and corruption in our government.
threats;--;doc5.txt;--;The overwhelming presence of our troops, our intelligence, and our resources in Iraq has stretched our military to the breaking point and distracted us from the growing threats of a dangerous world.
threats;--;doc2.txt;--;I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease.
wealth;--;doc4.txt;--;You will decide if the standards and the rules will be the same for everyone - regardless of ethnicity or of wealth.
wealth;--;doc2.txt;--;This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich.
powerful;--;doc1.txt;--;And I accepted the job, sight unseen, motivated then by a single, simple, powerful idea - that I might play a small part in building a better America.
powerful;--;doc2.txt;--;We have the most powerful military on Earth, but that's not what makes us strong.
reform;--;doc4.txt;--;In today's Kenya - a Kenya already more open and less repressive than in my father's day - it is that courage that will bring the reform so many of you so desperately want and deserve.
reform;--;doc1.txt;--;I was proud to help lead the fight in Congress that led to the most sweeping ethics reform since Watergate.
ways;--;doc4.txt;--;So if the government found ways to downsize the bureaucracy - to cut out the positions that aren't necessary or useful - it could use the extra money to increase the salary of other government officials.
ways;--;doc1.txt;--;But I've been there long enough to know that the ways of Washington must change.
ways;--;doc3.txt;--;That she was born under the cloud of Jim Crow, free in theory but still enslaved in so many ways.
ways;--;doc2.txt;--;As President, I will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology, and find ways to safely harness nuclear power.
nuclear;--;doc6.txt;--;My third recommendation - which I'll just touch briefly on and let Senator Lugar talk about in more detail - is that we need to start thinking creatively about some of the next-generation efforts on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons.

community;--;doc2.txt;--;And we will keep our promise to every young American - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education.
mccain;--;doc2.txt;--;So I've got news for you, John McCain.
running;--;doc1.txt;--;All of us running for president will travel around the country offering ten-point plans and making grand speeches; all of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead the country.
running;--;doc3.txt;--;We're tired of being divided, tired of running into ideological walls and partisan roadblocks, tired of appeals to our worst instincts and greatest fears.
active;--;doc1.txt;--;I became a civil rights lawyer, and taught constitutional law, and after a time, I came to understand that our cherished rights of liberty and equality depend on the active participation of an awakened electorate.
active;--;doc5.txt;--;Such a reduced but active presence will also send a clear message to hostile countries like Iran and Syria that we intend to remain a key player in this region.
strengthening;--;doc1.txt;--;Each of us, in our own lives, will have to accept responsibility - for instilling an ethic of achievement in our children, for adapting to a more competitive economy, for strengthening our communities, and sharing some measure of sacrifice.
strengthening;--;doc5.txt;--;money that could have been devoted to strengthening our homeland security and our competitive standing as a nation.
simply;--;doc1.txt;--;I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill.
simply;--;doc6.txt;--;For a scientist or other employee to simply walk out of the lab with enough material to construct a weapon of mass destruction is far too easy, and the consequences would be far too devastating.
simply;--;doc5.txt;--;Such lack of foresight is simply inexcusable.
likes;--;doc2.txt;--;John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell - but he won't even go to the cave where he lives.
learning;--;doc1.txt;--;All of us know what those challenges are today - a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our future, schools where too many children aren't learning, and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can.
cynicism;--;doc4.txt;--;But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict.
cynicism;--;doc3.txt;--;So I understand the cynicism.
cynicism;--;doc2.txt;--;Because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government.
wider;--;doc5.txt;--;And it is time to refocus America’s efforts on the wider struggle yet to be won.
table;--;doc1.txt;--;Letting the Iraqis know that we will not be there forever is our last, best hope to pressure the Sunni and Shia to come to the table and find peace.
table;--;doc5.txt;--;And all the troops in the world won’t be able to force Shia, Sunni, and Kurd to sit down at a table, resolve their differences, and forge a lasting peace.
throughout;--;doc6.txt;--;Throughout the Cold War, the Soviet Union was engaged in a massive undertaking in the field of germ warfare.
throughout;--;doc5.txt;--;But neither Iran nor Syria want to see a security vacuum in Iraq filled with chaos, terrorism, refugees, and violence, as it could have a destabilizing effect throughout the entire region ?
speak;--;doc4.txt;--;Of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see.
speak;--;doc6.txt;--;And as we speak, members of Al Qaeda and other terrorists organizations are aggressively pursuing weapons of mass destruction, which they would use without hesitation.
speak;--;doc2.txt;--;And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream.
conference;--;doc3.txt;--;You know, you probably never thought you'd hear this at a Take Back America conference, but Newt Gingrich made a great point a few weeks ago.
conference;--;doc5.txt;--;The goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of Iraq, prevent a further descent into civil war, and push the various Iraqi factions towards a political solution.
late;--;doc1.txt;--;Finally, there is one other thing that is not too late to get right about this war - and that is the homecoming of the men and women - our veterans - who have sacrificed the most.
late;--;doc6.txt;--;But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at American University in 1963 about threats posed by the Soviet Union.
strong;--;doc4.txt;--;By focusing on building strong, independent institutions - like an anti-corruption commission with real authority - rather than cults of personality, they make a contribution to their country that will last longer than their own lives.
strong;--;doc5.txt;--;And so we need to maintain a strong foreign policy, relentless in pursuing our enemies and hopeful in promoting our values around the world.
strong;--;doc2.txt;--;We have the most powerful military on Earth, but that's not what makes us strong.
raise;--;doc6.txt;--;Additionally, in the last few years, we've seen some disturbing trends from Russia itself - the deterioration of democracy and the rule of law, the abuses that have taken place in Chechnya, Russian meddling in the former Soviet Union - that raise serious questions about our relationship.
raise;--;doc2.txt;--;Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class.
agree;--;doc5.txt;--;According to a Pew survey, 42% of Americans now agree with the statement that the U.S. should "mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own.”We cannot afford to be a country of isolationists right now.
agree;--;doc2.txt;--;I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination.
union;--;doc1.txt;--;I want us to take up the unfinished business of perfecting our union, and building a better America.
union;--;doc6.txt;--;But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at American University in 1963 about threats posed by the Soviet Union.
union;--;doc5.txt;--;And on a trip to the former Soviet Union, I have seen the biological and nuclear weapons terrorists could easily steal while the world looks the other way.
union;--;doc2.txt;--;Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.
west;--;doc1.txt;--;We welcomed immigrants to our shores, we opened railroads to the west, we landed a man on the moon, and we heard a King's call to let justice roll down like water, and righteousness like a mighty stream.
west;--;doc2.txt;--;It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot.
create;--;doc4.txt;--;And the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests.
create;--;doc3.txt;--;I've had enough of giving billions away to the oil companies when we're told that we can't invest in the renewable energy that will create jobs and lower gas prices and finally free us from our dependence on the oil wells of Saudi Arabia.
create;--;doc5.txt;--;to pressure the Iraqi leadership to finally come to a political agreement between the warring factions that can create some sense of stability in the country and bring this conflict under control.
create;--;doc2.txt;--;I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start-ups that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow.
political;--;doc4.txt;--;It suffers from the legacy of colonialism, of national boundaries that were drawn without regard to the political and tribal alignments of indigenous peoples, and that therefore fed conflict and tribal strife.
political;--;doc1.txt;--;It's time to admit that no amount of American lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone else's civil war.
political;--;doc5.txt;--;Much has been written about how the military invasion of Iraq was planned without any thought to what political situation we would find after Baghdad fell.
political;--;doc2.txt;--;But what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes.

three;--;doc3.txt;--;She believed that over a span of three centuries, she had seen enough to know that there is no challenge too great, no injustice too crippling, no destiny too far out of reach for America.

three;--;doc2.txt;--;In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships.
three;--;doc1.txt;--;After three years of this work, I went to law school, because I wanted to understand how the law should work for those in need.
three;--;doc6.txt;--;Our detention for three hours in Perm is a testament to these forces.
hard-earned;--;doc1.txt;--;Let's protect the hard-earned benefits their companies have promised.
hard-earned;--;doc5.txt;--;They have spent hundreds of billions of their hard-earned dollars on this effort ?
strategy;--;doc1.txt;--;For the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight.
strategy;--;doc5.txt;--;As we change strategy in Iraq, we should also think about what Iraq has taught us about America’s strategy in the wider struggle against rogue threats and international terrorism.
strategy;--;doc2.txt;--;If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need.
spur;--;doc1.txt;--;We can harness homegrown, alternative fuels like ethanol and spur the production of more fuel-efficient cars.
spur;--;doc3.txt;--;The party that will harness homegrown, alternative fuels and spur the production of fuel-efficient, hybrid cars to break our dependence on the world's most dangerous regimes.
reduction;--;doc6.txt;--;And we need to work together to obtain a bilateral agreement on biological threat reduction.
reduction;--;doc5.txt;--;Moreover, it could be suspended if at any point U.S. commanders believe that a further reduction would put American troops in danger.
much;--;doc4.txt;--;It is rooted in the bankrupt idea that the goal of politics or business is to funnel as much of the pie as possible to one's family, tribe, or circle with little regard for the public good.
much;--;doc6.txt;--;Much of what President Kennedy described in 1963 remains true to this day - and we owe it to ourselves and our children to get it right.
much;--;doc5.txt;--;Much has been written about how the military invasion of Iraq was planned without any thought to what political situation we would find after Baghdad fell.
much;--;doc2.txt;--;Not with so much work to be done.
growth;--;doc4.txt;--;I know that while recent reports have pointed to strong economic growth in this country, 56% of Kenyans still live in poverty.
growth;--;doc2.txt;--;It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road.
interest;--;doc6.txt;--;But when we think about the threat that these weapons pose to our global security, we cannot allow the U.S.-Russian relationship to deteriorate to the point where Russia does not think it's in their best interest to help us finish the job we started.
interest;--;doc3.txt;--;And let it be said that we are the party of open, honest government that doesn't peddle the agenda of whichever lobbyist or special interest can write the biggest check.
interest;--;doc5.txt;--;This doesn’t mean abandoning our values and ideals; wherever we can, it’s in our interest to help foster democracy through the diplomatic and economic resources at our disposal.
basic;--;doc6.txt;--;"Let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved...For in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet.
basic;--;doc5.txt;--;We need to continue to provide some basic reconstruction funding that will be used to put Iraqis to work and help our troops stabilize key areas.
borders;--;doc6.txt;--;On our trip, we saw two areas where this is possible: elimination of heavy conventional weapons, and interdiction efforts to help stop the flow of dangerous materials across borders.
borders;--;doc3.txt;--;Four years after 9/11, I've had enough of being told that we can find the money to give Paris Hilton more tax cuts, but we can't find enough to protect our ports or our railroads or our chemical plants or our borders.
fdr;--;doc3.txt;--;And how she watched FDR lift this nation out of fear and send millions to college on the GI Bill and lift millions out of poverty with Social Security.
fdr;--;doc5.txt;--;And so we must realize that the freedoms FDR once spoke of ?
meeting;--;doc4.txt;--;But there are so many others, some of whom I'm meeting during my visit here - Betty Murungi, Ken Njau, Jane Onyango, Maina Kiai, Milly Odhiombo, and Hussein Khalid.
meeting;--;doc1.txt;--;What's stopped us from meeting these challenges is not the absence of sound policies and sensible plans.
duties;--;doc4.txt;--;As well as numerous Kenyan men and women who have refused to pay bribes to get civil servants to perform their duties; the auditors and inspectors general who have done the job before them accurately and fairly, regardless of where the facts have led; the journalists who asked questions and pushed for answers when it may have been more lucrative to look the other way, or whip up a convenient fiction.
duties;--;doc5.txt;--;The American soldiers I met when I traveled to Iraq this year were performing their duties with bravery, with brilliance, and without question.
define;--;doc5.txt;--;If we commit our troops anywhere in the world, it is our solemn responsibility to define their mission and formulate a viable plan to fulfill that mission and bring our troops home.
define;--;doc2.txt;--;Why else would he define middle-class as someone making under five million dollars a year?
wants;--;doc3.txt;--;And in the midst of this rally, someone comes up to me and says that there's a woman who'd like to come meet you, and she's traveled a long way and she wants to take a picture and shake your hand.
wants;--;doc2.txt;--;If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need.
undetermined;--;doc5.txt;--;I said then and believe now that Saddam Hussein was a ruthless dictator who craved weapons of mass destruction but posed no imminent threat to the United States; that a war in Iraq would harm, not help, our efforts to defeat al Qaeda and finish the job in Afghanistan; and that an invasion would require an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences.
life;--;doc4.txt;--;In many ways, then, my family's life reflects some of the contradictions of Kenya, and indeed, the African continent as a whole.
life;--;doc1.txt;--;But the life of a tall, gangly, self-made Springfield lawyer tells us that a different future is possible.
life;--;doc3.txt;--;It allows us to say to those whose health care or tuition may rise faster than they can afford - life isn't fair.
life;--;doc2.txt;--;But what the people heard instead - people of every creed and color, from every walk of life - is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked.
shia;--;doc1.txt;--;Letting the Iraqis know that we will not be there forever is our last, best hope to pressure the Sunni and Shia to come to the table and find peace.
shia;--;doc5.txt;--;And all the troops in the world won’t be able to force Shia, Sunni, and Kurd to sit down at a table, resolve their differences, and forge a lasting peace.
families;--;doc4.txt;--;Certainly it is not due to lack of effort on the part of ordinary Kenyans - we know how hard Kenyans are willing to work, the tremendous sacrifices that Kenyan mothers make for their children, the Herculean efforts that Kenyan fathers make for their families.
families;--;doc1.txt;--;Today we grieve for the families who have lost loved ones, the hearts that have been broken, and the young lives that could have been.
families;--;doc3.txt;--;The party that won't just throw a few tax breaks at families who can't afford their insurance, but modernizes our health care system and gives every family a chance to buy insurance at a price they can afford.
families;--;doc5.txt;--;There have been too many flag-draped coffins, and there have been too many heartbroken families.
families;--;doc2.txt;--;Not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend.
gay;--;doc1.txt;--;We're distracted from our real failures, and told to blame the other party, or gay people, or immigrants.
gay;--;doc2.txt;--;I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination.
turned;--;doc1.txt;--;The cynics, and the lobbyists, and the special interests who've turned our government into a game only they can afford to play.
turned;--;doc6.txt;--;At this point I turned around and said "Hey, where's Lugar?
turned;--;doc5.txt;--;Neither turned out to be true.
turned;--;doc2.txt;--;In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships.
offered;--;doc1.txt;--;But a group of churches had offered me a job as a community organizer for $13,000 a year.
offered;--;doc3.txt;--;At one point, Kozol tells about his trip to Fremont High School in Los Angeles, where he met a girl who tells him that she'd taken hairdressing twice, because there were actually two different levels offered by the high school.
republicans;--;doc3.txt;--;He was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the Republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the Democrats should come down to just two words:Had enough?
republicans;--;doc5.txt;--;A year in which well-respected Republicans like John Warner, former Administration officials like Colin Powell, generals who have served in Iraq, and intelligence experts have all said that what we are doing is not working.
republicans;--;doc2.txt;--;In the Republicans who never thought they'd pick up a Democratic ballot, but did.
gas;--;doc3.txt;--;I've had enough of giving billions away to the oil companies when we're told that we can't invest in the renewable energy that will create jobs and lower gas prices and finally free us from our dependence on the oil wells of Saudi Arabia.
gas;--;doc2.txt;--;As President, I will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology, and find ways to safely harness nuclear power.
climate;--;doc4.txt;--;Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive.
climate;--;doc1.txt;--;For the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight.
climate;--;doc2.txt;--;I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease.

rebuild;--;doc2.txt;--;Not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save.
whatever;--;doc5.txt;--;And this has been true for those of us who looked on the rubble and ashes of 9/11, and made a solemn pledge that such an atrocity would never again happen on United States soil; that we would do whatever it took to hunt down those responsible, and use every tool at our disposal ?
whatever;--;doc2.txt;--;Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.
lift;--;doc1.txt;--;And let's allow our unions and their organizers to lift up this country's middle-class again.

lift;--;doc5.txt;--;“rejected the notion of an American ‘timeline’ for action on urgent Iraqi political issues; ordered American commanders to lift checkpoints they had set up around the Shiite district of Sadr City to hunt for a kidnapped American soldier and a fugitive Shiite death squad leader; and blamed the Americans for the deteriorating security situation in Iraq.”This is now the reality of Iraq.

lives;--;doc1.txt;--;It's time to admit that no amount of American lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone else's civil war.

lives;--;doc2.txt;--;Not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend.
representative;--;doc4.txt;--;In just the last year, our own U.S. Congress has seen a representative resign after taking bribes, and several others fall under investigation for using their public office for private gain.
child;--;doc1.txt;--;Every single person willing to work should be able to get job training that leads to a job, and earn a living wage that can pay the bills, and afford child care so their kids have a safe place to go when they work.
child;--;doc3.txt;--;It allows us to say to the child who didn't have the foresight to choose the right parents or be born in the right suburb - pick yourself up by your bootstraps.
child;--;doc2.txt;--;Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers.
worked;--;doc1.txt;--;I've worked with Republican Senator Dick Lugar to pass a law that will secure and destroy some of the world's deadliest, unguarded weapons.

worked;--;doc2.txt;--;I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands.
trickles;--;doc3.txt;--;And I've had enough of being told that all we can do about this is sit and wait and hope that the good fortune of a few trickles on down to everyone else in this country.
trickles;--;doc2.txt;--;For over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy - give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else.
despite;--;doc4.txt;--;I learned about the brutal repression of Operation Anvil, the days of rape and torture in the "Pipeline" camps, the lives that so many gave, and how my grandfather had been arrested briefly during this period, despite being at the periphery of Kenya's liberation struggles.
despite;--;doc1.txt;--;All of us know what those challenges are today - a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our future, schools where too many children aren't learning, and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can.
despite;--;doc2.txt;--;And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman.
former;--;doc6.txt;--;Additionally, in the last few years, we've seen some disturbing trends from Russia itself - the deterioration of democracy and the rule of law, the abuses that have taken place in Chechnya, Russian meddling in the former Soviet Union - that raise serious questions about our relationship.
former;--;doc5.txt;--;And on a trip to the former Soviet Union, I have seen the biological and nuclear weapons terrorists could easily steal while the world looks the other way.
aid;--;doc5.txt;--;But we need to also move towards more condition-based aid packages where economic assistance is contingent upon the ability of Iraqis to make measurable progress on reducing sectarian violence and forging a lasting political settlement.
play;--;doc1.txt;--;And although government will play a crucial role in bringing about the changes we need, more money and programs alone will not get us where we need to go.
play;--;doc6.txt;--;Everyone has a role to play, and everyone must accelerate this involvement.

conception;--;doc5.txt;--;But I have long believed it has also been a failure of conception ?
look;--;doc4.txt;--;You will decide if your leaders will be held accountable, or if you will look the other way.
look;--;doc3.txt;--;And then someday, someday, if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the 21st century, they can say that this was the time when America renewed its purpose.
look;--;doc5.txt;--;a willingness on the part of each of us to look past what is petty and small and sensational, and look ahead to what is necessary and purposeful.

citizens;--;doc4.txt;--;But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict.
citizens;--;doc2.txt;--;To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation;With profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.

failing;--;doc4.txt;--;Like many nations across this continent, where Kenya is failing is in its ability to create a government that is transparent and accountable.
failing;--;doc5.txt;--;It is not enough for him to simply lay out benchmarks for progress with no consequences attached for failing to meet them.
well;--;doc4.txt;--;As I said at the outset, I did not know my father well - he returned to Kenya from America when I was still young.
well;--;doc6.txt;--;While they are often difficult to use, they are easy to transport, hard to detect, and, as we saw in Kiev, not always well secured.
well;--;doc3.txt;--;Well it's time we finally said we notice, and we care, and we're not gonna settle anymore.
well;--;doc5.txt;--;do not just come from deposing a tyrant and handing out ballots; they are only realized once the personal and material security of a people is ensured as well.
well;--;doc2.txt;--;The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past.
spent;--;doc1.txt;--;I know I haven't spent a lot of time learning the ways of Washington.
spent;--;doc6.txt;--;The Department of Energy and others have certainly made progress in converting civilian reactors to low-enriched uranium, taking back spent fuel, and closing unnecessary facilities.
spent;--;doc5.txt;--;They have spent hundreds of billions of their hard-earned dollars on this effort ?
spent;--;doc2.txt;--;I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I haven't spent my career in the halls of Washington.
fighting;--;doc4.txt;--;The world knows the names of Wangari Maathai and John Githongo, who are fighting against the insidious corruption that has weakened Kenya.
options;--;doc5.txt;--;There are no options that do not carry significant risks.
thought;--;doc1.txt;--;I thought it was a tragic mistake.
thought;--;doc3.txt;--;I've often thought about Mireya and her simple dream and all those before her who've shared that dream too.
thought;--;doc5.txt;--;Much has been written about how the military invasion of Iraq was planned without any thought to what political situation we would find after Baghdad fell.
thought;--;doc2.txt;--;In the Republicans who never thought they'd pick up a Democratic ballot, but did.
person;--;doc1.txt;--;Every single person willing to work should be able to get job training that leads to a job, and earn a living wage that can pay the bills, and afford child care so their kids have a safe place to go when they work.
person;--;doc3.txt;--;And after consulting with these higher powers, I threw my hat in the ring and I did what every person on a campaign does - I talked to anyone who'd listen.
person;--;doc2.txt;--;I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination.
accountable;--;doc4.txt;--;You will decide if your leaders will be held accountable, or if you will look the other way.
accountable;--;doc2.txt;--;I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands.
without;--;doc4.txt;--;As a result, many African nations have been asked to liberalize their markets without reciprocal concessions from mature economies.
without;--;doc1.txt;--;It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable - that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst.
without;--;doc6.txt;--;And as we speak, members of Al Qaeda and other terrorists organizations are aggressively pursuing weapons of mass destruction, which they would use without hesitation.
without;--;doc5.txt;--;Much has been written about how the military invasion of Iraq was planned without any thought to what political situation we would find after Baghdad fell.
without;--;doc2.txt;--;Let us keep that promise - that American promise - and in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess.
allow;--;doc1.txt;--;And let's allow our unions and their organizers to lift up this country's middle-class again.
allow;--;doc6.txt;--;But when we think about the threat that these weapons pose to our global security, we cannot allow the U.S.-Russian relationship to deteriorate to the point where Russia does not think it's in their best interest to help us finish the job we started.
allow;--;doc5.txt;--;This force could help prevent the conflict in Iraq from becoming a wider war, consolidate gains in Northern Iraq, reassure allies in the Gulf, allow our troops to strike directly at al Qaeda wherever it may exist, and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region.
greatest;--;doc6.txt;--;And that is why the nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons within the borders of the former Soviet Union represent the greatest threat to the security of the United States - a threat we need to think seriously and intelligently about in the months to come.
greatest;--;doc3.txt;--;We're tired of being divided, tired of running into ideological walls and partisan roadblocks, tired of appeals to our worst instincts and greatest fears.
greatest;--;doc5.txt;--;The first part of this strategy begins by exerting the greatest leverage we have on the Iraqi government ?
greatest;--;doc2.txt;--;That promise is our greatest inheritance.
mother;--;doc4.txt;--;Since that time I have known him through stories - those my mother would tell and those I heard from my relatives here in Kenya on my last trip to this country.
mother;--;doc3.txt;--;My mother sews.
mother;--;doc2.txt;--;Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers.
shiite;--;doc5.txt;--;“rejected the notion of an American ‘timeline’ for action on urgent Iraqi political issues; ordered American commanders to lift checkpoints they had set up around the Shiite district of Sadr City to hunt for a kidnapped American soldier and a fugitive Shiite death squad leader; and blamed the Americans for the deteriorating security situation in Iraq.”This is now the reality of Iraq.
model;--;doc4.txt;--;Among African nations, Kenya remains a model for representative democracy - a place where many different ethnic factions have found a way to live and work together in peace and stability.
model;--;doc1.txt;--;We can turn this crisis of global warming into a moment of opportunity for innovation, and job creation, and an incentive for businesses that will serve as a model for the world.
model;--;doc6.txt;--;Fortunately, the success of Cooperative Threat Reduction - especially in securing nuclear weapons - serves as a model of how we can do this.
reward;--;doc2.txt;--;Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it.
soviet;--;doc6.txt;--;But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at American University in 1963 about threats posed by the Soviet Union.
soviet;--;doc5.txt;--;And on a trip to the former Soviet Union, I have seen the biological and nuclear weapons terrorists could easily steal while the world looks the other way.
prevention;--;doc1.txt;--;We can control costs by focusing on prevention, by providing better treatment to the chronically ill, and using technology to cut the bureaucracy.
prevention;--;doc5.txt;--;and most importantly, the prevention of these terrorist organizations from obtaining weapons of mass destruction -- will require the cooperation of many nations.
meet;--;doc3.txt;--;And in the midst of this rally, someone comes up to me and says that there's a woman who'd like to come meet you, and she's traveled a long way and she wants to take a picture and shake your hand.
meet;--;doc5.txt;--;It is not enough for him to simply lay out benchmarks for progress with no consequences attached for failing to meet them.
meet;--;doc2.txt;--;I will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts.
restore;--;doc2.txt;--;And that's what we have to restore.
stake;--;doc6.txt;--;But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at American University in 1963 about threats posed by the Soviet Union.
stake;--;doc3.txt;--;The idea that everybody has a stake in the country, that we're all in it together and everybody's got a shot at opportunity.
stake;--;doc5.txt;--;Finally, we have to realize that the entire Middle East has an enormous stake in the outcome of Iraq, and we must engage neighboring countries in finding a solution.
blessed;--;doc4.txt;--;And we know how much this land is blessed - just as the entire African continent is blessed - with great gifts and riches.
traditions;--;doc4.txt;--;The history of Africa is a history of ancient kingdoms and great traditions; the story of people fighting to be free from colonial rule; the heroism of not only of great men like Nkrumah and Kenyatta and Mandela, but also ordinary people who endured great hardship, from Ghana to South Africa, to secure self-determination in the face of great odds.
less;--;doc4.txt;--;In today's Kenya - a Kenya already more open and less repressive than in my father's day - it is that courage that will bring the reform so many of you so desperately want and deserve.
less;--;doc6.txt;--;One way we could strengthen this relationship is by thinking about the Russians as more of a partner and less of a subordinate in the Cooperative Threat Reduction effort.
less;--;doc3.txt;--;And as a result, we've seen families work harder for less and our jobs go overseas.
less;--;doc5.txt;--;As a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the U.S. troops remaining in Iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and American enclaves like the Green Zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists.
less;--;doc2.txt;--;But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy.
moments;--;doc3.txt;--;And I think that we face one of those moments today.
moments;--;doc5.txt;--;Throughout American history, there have been moments that call on us to meet the challenges of an uncertain world, and pay whatever price is required to secure our freedom.
moments;--;doc2.txt;--;America, this is one of those moments.
money;--;doc4.txt;--;So if the government found ways to downsize the bureaucracy - to cut out the positions that aren't necessary or useful - it could use the extra money to increase the salary of other government officials.
money;--;doc1.txt;--;And although government will play a crucial role in bringing about the changes we need, more money and programs alone will not get us where we need to go.
money;--;doc3.txt;--;Four years after 9/11, I've had enough of being told that we can find the money to give Paris Hilton more tax cuts, but we can't find enough to protect our ports or our railroads or our chemical plants or our borders.
money;--;doc5.txt;--;money that could have been devoted to strengthening our homeland security and our competitive standing as a nation.
money;--;doc2.txt;--;And Democrats, we must also admit that fulfilling America's promise will require more than just money.
sights;--;doc2.txt;--;When John McCain said we could just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights.
rest;--;doc1.txt;--;It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people - as Americans.
rest;--;doc6.txt;--;With the situation in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union so drastically different than it was in 1991, or even in 1996 or 2001, what must we do to effectively confront this threat in the days and years to come?
rest;--;doc5.txt;--;9/11 showed us that try as we might to ignore the rest of the world, our enemies will no longer ignore us.
gun;--;doc5.txt;--;cannot be built overnight, and they cannot be built at the end of a barrel of a gun.
gun;--;doc2.txt;--;The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang-violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals.
communities;--;doc1.txt;--;Each of us, in our own lives, will have to accept responsibility - for instilling an ethic of achievement in our children, for adapting to a more competitive economy, for strengthening our communities, and sharing some measure of sacrifice.
mistakes;--;doc4.txt;--;As our parents' children, we have the opportunity to learn from these mistakes and disappointments.
mistakes;--;doc3.txt;--;He was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the Republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the Democrats should come down to just two words:Had enough?
mistakes;--;doc5.txt;--;There is one other place where our mistakes in Iraq have cost us dearly ?
distant;--;doc1.txt;--;I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill.
distant;--;doc3.txt;--;How she saw unions rise up and a middle-class prosper, and watched immigrants leave distant shores in search of an idea known as America.
thanks;--;doc1.txt;--;Let me begin by saying thanks to all you who've traveled, from far and wide, to brave the cold today.
thanks;--;doc6.txt;--;Of course, Dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs he co-founded with Senator Sam Nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former Soviet Union after the Cold War.
thanks;--;doc2.txt;--;Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest - a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours -- Hillary Rodham Clinton.
questions;--;doc4.txt;--;As well as numerous Kenyan men and women who have refused to pay bribes to get civil servants to perform their duties; the auditors and inspectors general who have done the job before them accurately and fairly, regardless of where the facts have led; the journalists who asked questions and pushed for answers when it may have been more lucrative to look the other way, or whip up a convenient fiction.
questions;--;doc6.txt;--;Additionally, in the last few years, we've seen some disturbing trends from Russia itself - the deterioration of democracy and the rule of law, the abuses that have taken place in Chechnya, Russian meddling in the former Soviet Union - that raise serious questions about our relationship.
questions;--;doc3.txt;--;We are here tonight because we believe that in this country, we have it within our power to say "yes" to those questions - to forge our own destiny - to begin the world anew.
questions;--;doc5.txt;--;No matter how bad it gets, we are told to wait, and not ask questions.
using;--;doc4.txt;--;In just the last year, our own U.S. Congress has seen a representative resign after taking bribes, and several others fall under investigation for using their public office for private gain.
using;--;doc1.txt;--;We can control costs by focusing on prevention, by providing better treatment to the chronically ill, and using technology to cut the bureaucracy.
using;--;doc5.txt;--;And a report by our own intelligence agencies has concluded that al Qaeda is successfully using the war in Iraq to recruit a new generation of terrorists for its war on America.
facts;--;doc4.txt;--;As well as numerous Kenyan men and women who have refused to pay bribes to get civil servants to perform their duties; the auditors and inspectors general who have done the job before them accurately and fairly, regardless of where the facts have led; the journalists who asked questions and pushed for answers when it may have been more lucrative to look the other way, or whip up a convenient fiction.
facts;--;doc5.txt;--;a strategy no longer driven by ideology and politics, but one that is based on a realistic assessment of the sobering facts on the ground and our interests in the region.
regardless;--;doc4.txt;--;You will decide if the standards and the rules will be the same for everyone - regardless of ethnicity or of wealth.
yes;--;doc3.txt;--;We are here tonight because we believe that in this country, we have it within our power to say "yes" to those questions - to forge our own destiny - to begin the world anew.
yes;--;doc2.txt;--;Yes, we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair.
whiners;--;doc2.txt;--;These are not whiners.
yet;--;doc4.txt;--;And yet, the reason I speak of the freedom that you fought so hard to win is because today that freedom is in jeopardy.
yet;--;doc6.txt;--;Yet, a serious threat still remains.
yet;--;doc5.txt;--;And it is time to refocus America’s efforts on the wider struggle yet to be won.
adding;--;doc5.txt;--;It’s not clear that these troop levels are sustainable for a significant period of time, and according to our commanders on the ground, adding American forces will only relieve the Iraqis from doing more on their own.
cut;--;doc4.txt;--;So if the government found ways to downsize the bureaucracy - to cut out the positions that aren't necessary or useful - it could use the extra money to increase the salary of other government officials.
cut;--;doc1.txt;--;We can control costs by focusing on prevention, by providing better treatment to the chronically ill, and using technology to cut the bureaucracy.
cut;--;doc2.txt;--;I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise.
family;--;doc4.txt;--;It is rooted in the bankrupt idea that the goal of politics or business is to funnel as much of the pie as possible to one's family, tribe, or circle with little regard for the public good.
family;--;doc1.txt;--;I was a young man then, just a year out of college; I knew no one in Chicago, was without money or family connections.
family;--;doc3.txt;--;The party that won't just throw a few tax breaks at families who can't afford their insurance, but modernizes our health care system and gives every family a chance to buy insurance at a price they can afford.
family;--;doc2.txt;--;Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent.
equipment;--;doc5.txt;--;We can teach the soldiers to fight and police to patrol, but if the Iraqi government will not properly feed, adequately pay, or provide them with the equipment they need, they will continue to desert in large numbers, or maintain fealty only to their religious group rather than the national government.
equipment;--;doc2.txt;--;As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home.
thinking;--;doc6.txt;--;But thinking of the Russians more as partners does mean being more thoughtful, respectful, and consistent about what we say and what we do.
workers;--;doc1.txt;--;And as our economy changes, let's be the generation that ensures our nation's workers are sharing in our prosperity.
workers;--;doc2.txt;--;It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot.
extra;--;doc4.txt;--;So if the government found ways to downsize the bureaucracy - to cut out the positions that aren't necessary or useful - it could use the extra money to increase the salary of other government officials.
extra;--;doc2.txt;--;We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma.
character;--;doc4.txt;--;By rejecting the insulting idea that corruption is somehow a part of Kenyan culture, these heroes reveal the very opposite - they reveal a strength and integrity of character that can build a great country, a great future.
character;--;doc2.txt;--;Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism.
realize;--;doc5.txt;--;And so we must realize that the freedoms FDR once spoke of ?
realize;--;doc2.txt;--;I realize that I am not the likeliest candidate for this office.
anthrax;--;doc6.txt;--;Here in Washington, we saw what happened when just two letters filled with just a few grams of Anthrax were sent to the U.S. Senate.
lets;--;doc3.txt;--;It lets us say to the guy who worked twenty or thirty years in the factory and then watched his plant move out to Mexico or China - we're sorry, but you're on your own.
lets;--;doc2.txt;--;We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes.
book;--;doc6.txt;--;As one book says, "disease by the ton was its industry."
book;--;doc3.txt;--;A while ago, I was reading through Jonathan Kozol's new book, Shame of a Nation, which tells of his travels to underprivileged schools across America.
parents;--;doc4.txt;--;As our parents' children, we have the opportunity to learn from these mistakes and disappointments.
parents;--;doc3.txt;--;It allows us to say to the child who didn't have the foresight to choose the right parents or be born in the right suburb - pick yourself up by your bootstraps.
parents;--;doc2.txt;--;But we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need.
bravery;--;doc5.txt;--;The American soldiers I met when I traveled to Iraq this year were performing their duties with bravery, with brilliance, and without question.
bravery;--;doc2.txt;--;The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect.
easy;--;doc4.txt;--;I don't have all the solutions or think that they'll be easy, but there are a few places that a country truly committed to reform could start.
easy;--;doc1.txt;--;And it won't be easy.
easy;--;doc6.txt;--;While they are often difficult to use, they are easy to transport, hard to detect, and, as we saw in Kiev, not always well secured.
easy;--;doc5.txt;--;But it will not be easy.
easy;--;doc2.txt;--;America, our work will not be easy.
east;--;doc1.txt;--;It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America.
east;--;doc5.txt;--;Finally, we have to realize that the entire Middle East has an enormous stake in the outcome of Iraq, and we must engage neighboring countries in finding a solution.
east;--;doc2.txt;--;And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East.
smart;--;doc3.txt;--;Let it be said that we will conduct a smart foreign policy that battles the forces of terrorism and fundamentalism wherever they may exist by matching the might of our military with the power of our diplomacy and the strength of our alliances.
build;--;doc4.txt;--;And you will determine the direction of this country in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger Kenya where everyone rises together.
build;--;doc1.txt;--;It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America.
build;--;doc6.txt;--;Some weapons experts believe that terrorists are likely to find enough fissile material to build a bomb in the next ten years - and we can imagine with horror what the world will be like if they succeed.
build;--;doc5.txt;--;Now, I am hopeful that the Iraq Study Group emerges next month with a series of proposals around which we can begin to build a bipartisan consensus.
build;--;doc2.txt;--;I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease.
real;--;doc4.txt;--;I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see.
real;--;doc1.txt;--;We're distracted from our real failures, and told to blame the other party, or gay people, or immigrants.
real;--;doc6.txt;--;We need to be sure that Nunn-Lugar is increasingly focused on these very real non-proliferation and bioterrorism threats.
real;--;doc2.txt;--;For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face.
march;--;doc1.txt;--;And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you.
march;--;doc2.txt;--;At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future.
around;--;doc1.txt;--;All of us running for president will travel around the country offering ten-point plans and making grand speeches; all of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead the country.
around;--;doc6.txt;--;But we've all seen how it could take far less time for these weapons to leak out and travel around the world, fueling insurgencies and violent conflicts from Africa to Afghanistan.
around;--;doc3.txt;--;But while the world has changed around us, too often our government has stood still.
around;--;doc5.txt;--;And so we need to maintain a strong foreign policy, relentless in pursuing our enemies and hopeful in promoting our values around the world.
around;--;doc2.txt;--;Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend.
government;--;doc4.txt;--;An accountable, transparent government can break this cycle.
government;--;doc3.txt;--;And let it be said that we are the party of open, honest government that doesn't peddle the agenda of whichever lobbyist or special interest can write the biggest check.
government;--;doc5.txt;--;We can teach the soldiers to fight and police to patrol, but if the Iraqi government will not properly feed, adequately pay, or provide them with the equipment they need, they will continue to desert in large numbers, or maintain fealty only to their religious group rather than the national government.
government;--;doc2.txt;--;I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands.
government;--;doc1.txt;--;And although government will play a crucial role in bringing about the changes we need, more money and programs alone will not get us where we need to go.
government;--;doc6.txt;--;While the government of Ukraine is making progress here, the limited funding they have means that at the current pace, it will take sixty years to dismantle these weapons.
rules;--;doc4.txt;--;You will decide if the standards and the rules will be the same for everyone - regardless of ethnicity or of wealth.
rules;--;doc2.txt;--;It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road.
big;--;doc1.txt;--;What's stopped us is the failure of leadership, the smallness of our politics - the ease with which we're distracted by the petty and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough decisions, our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems.
big;--;doc3.txt;--;The idea that some problems are just too big to handle, and if you just ignore them, sooner or later, they'll go away.
big;--;doc2.txt;--;You make a big election about small things.
breaks;--;doc3.txt;--;The party that won't just throw a few tax breaks at families who can't afford their insurance, but modernizes our health care system and gives every family a chance to buy insurance at a price they can afford.
breaks;--;doc2.txt;--;Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America.
posed;--;doc6.txt;--;But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at American University in 1963 about threats posed by the Soviet Union.
posed;--;doc5.txt;--;I said then and believe now that Saddam Hussein was a ruthless dictator who craved weapons of mass destruction but posed no imminent threat to the United States; that a war in Iraq would harm, not help, our efforts to defeat al Qaeda and finish the job in Afghanistan; and that an invasion would require an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences.
possible;--;doc4.txt;--;It is rooted in the bankrupt idea that the goal of politics or business is to funnel as much of the pie as possible to one's family, tribe, or circle with little regard for the public good.
possible;--;doc1.txt;--;But the life of a tall, gangly, self-made Springfield lawyer tells us that a different future is possible.
possible;--;doc6.txt;--;On our trip, we saw two areas where this is possible: elimination of heavy conventional weapons, and interdiction efforts to help stop the flow of dangerous materials across borders.
possible;--;doc3.txt;--;These are Americans who still believe in an America where anything's possible - they just don't think their leaders do.
possible;--;doc5.txt;--;When possible, this should be done in consultation with the Iraqi government ?
regard;--;doc4.txt;--;It is rooted in the bankrupt idea that the goal of politics or business is to funnel as much of the pie as possible to one's family, tribe, or circle with little regard for the public good.
regard;--;doc3.txt;--;But it has also depended on our sense of mutual regard for each other, of mutual responsibility.
early;--;doc4.txt;--;This coalition succeeded by promising change, and their early gestures - the dismissal of the shaky judges, the renewed vigor of the investigation into the Goldenberg scandal, the calls for real disclosure of elected officials' personal wealth - were all promising.
early;--;doc6.txt;--;Additional steps should also be taken to consolidate and secure dangerous pathogen collections, strengthen bio-reconnaissance networks to provide early warning of bio-attack and natural disease outbreaks, and have our experts work together to develop improved medical countermeasures.

early;--;doc2.txt;--;I'll invest in early childhood education.
smallness;--;doc1.txt;--;What's stopped us is the failure of leadership, the smallness of our politics - the ease with which we're distracted by the petty and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough decisions, our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems.
smallness;--;doc3.txt;--;It's the timidity - the smallness - of our politics that's holding us back right now.
suffering;--;doc4.txt;--;Clarifying these rules and focusing resources on building a judicial system that can enforce them and resolve disputes should be a primary goal of any government suffering from corruption.

mom;--;doc2.txt;--;In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships.
press;--;doc4.txt;--;You enjoy a robust civil society; a press that's free, fair, and honest; and a strong partnership with my own country that has resulted in critical cooperation on terrorist issues, real strides in fighting disease and poverty, and an important alliance on fostering regional stability.

world;--;doc4.txt;--;The world knows the names of Wangari Maathai and John Githongo, who are fighting against the insidious corruption that has weakened Kenya.
world;--;doc3.txt;--;We are here tonight because we believe that in this country, we have it within our power to say "yes" to those questions - to forge our own destiny - to begin the world anew.

world;--;doc1.txt;--;I've worked with Republican Senator Dick Lugar to pass a law that will secure and destroy some of the world's deadliest, unguarded weapons.
world;--;doc6.txt;--;But we've all seen how it could take far less time for these weapons to leak out and travel around the world, fueling insurgencies and violent conflicts from Africa to Afghanistan.
walk;--;doc1.txt;--;It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people - as Americans.

dreams;--;doc2.txt;--;That together, our dreams can be one.
nairobi;--;doc4.txt;--;Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive.
meaning;--;doc1.txt;--;This campaign has to be about reclaiming the meaning of citizenship, restoring our sense of common purpose, and realizing that few obstacles can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change.

necessary;--;doc4.txt;--;So if the government found ways to downsize the bureaucracy - to cut out the positions that aren't necessary or useful - it could use the extra money to increase the salary of other government officials.
necessary;--;doc6.txt;--;One of the most important steps is for Russia to permit the access and transparency necessary to deal with the threat.
necessary;--;doc5.txt;--;We would make clear in such a scenario that the United States would not be maintaining permanent military bases in Iraq, but would do what was necessary to help prevent a total collapse of the Iraqi state and further polarization of Iraqi society.

lost;--;doc1.txt;--;Today we grieve for the families who have lost loved ones, the hearts that have been broken, and the young lives that could have been.
lost;--;doc2.txt;--;What has also been lost is our sense of common purpose - our sense of higher purpose.
kennedy;--;doc6.txt;--;Much of what President Kennedy described in 1963 remains true to this day - and we owe it to ourselves and our children to get it right.
kennedy;--;doc2.txt;--;We are the party of Kennedy.

confront;--;doc6.txt;--;With the situation in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union so drastically different than it was in 1991, or even in 1996 or 2001, what must we do to effectively confront this threat in the days and years to come?
confront;--;doc5.txt;--;And so going forward, I believe there are strategic lessons to be learned from this as we continue to confront the new threats of this new century.

continue;--;doc4.txt;--;But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict.

night;--;doc2.txt;--;It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot.

become;--;doc5.txt;--;The notion that Iraq would quickly and easily become a bulwark of flourishing democracy in the Middle East was not a plan for victory, but an ideological fantasy.

fault;--;doc1.txt;--;And when all else fails, when Katrina happens, or the death toll in Iraq mounts, we've been told that our crises are somebody else's fault.
reduced;--;doc5.txt;--;Such a reduced but active presence will also send a clear message to hostile countries like Iran and Syria that we intend to remain a key player in this region.
losing;--;doc2.txt;--;I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise.

right;--;doc6.txt;--;Much of what President Kennedy described in 1963 remains true to this day - and we owe it to ourselves and our children to get it right.
old;--;doc4.txt;--;This means that the education and health care systems - issues that my own nation more than 200 years old still struggles with - lag behind, impacting its development.
old;--;doc1.txt;--;And that is why, in the shadow of the Old State Capitol, where Lincoln once called on a divided house to stand together, where common hopes and common dreams still, I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for President of the United States.
old;--;doc3.txt;--;I don't know about you, but I think old Newt is onto something here.

lead;--;doc5.txt;--;An increase in the quality and quantity of U.S. personnel in training and advisory roles can guard against militia infiltration of Iraqi units; develop the trust and goodwill of Iraqi soldiers and the local populace; and lead to better intelligence while undercutting grassroots support for the insurgents.

decision;--;doc1.txt;--;I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill.
decision;--;doc3.txt;--;Well, I thought about it, and then I did what every wise man does when faced with a difficult decision: I prayed, and I asked my wife.

question;--;doc6.txt;--;And so the question we need to be asking ourselves today is, what is the future of this program?
question;--;doc3.txt;--;And I understood the question because it revealed the cynicism people feel about public life today.
question;--;doc5.txt;--;The American soldiers I met when I traveled to Iraq this year were performing their duties with bravery, with brilliance, and without question.

long;--;doc4.txt;--;I discovered the beauty of the land, a beauty that haunts you long after you've left.
long;--;doc1.txt;--;But Washington has a long way to go.

fight;--;doc5.txt;--;standing up an army composed mainly of Shiites and Kurds will only cause the Sunnis to feel more threatened and fight even harder.
fight;--;doc2.txt;--;I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan.
start;--;doc4.txt;--;And the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests.
start;--;doc1.txt;--;America, it's time to start bringing our troops home.
start;--;doc6.txt;--;My third recommendation - which I'll just touch briefly on and let Senator Lugar talk about in more detail - is that we need to start thinking creatively about some of the next-generation efforts on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons.
start;--;doc2.txt;--;Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America.
bankrupts;--;doc3.txt;--;The party that won't make Americans choose between a health care plan that bankrupts the government and one that bankrupts families.
fought;--;doc4.txt;--;This is the Kenya that so many who came before you envisioned - all those men and women who struggled and sacrificed and fought for the freedom you enjoy today.
fought;--;doc1.txt;--;As Lincoln organized the forces arrayed against slavery, he was heard to say: "Of strange, discordant, and even hostile elements, we gathered from the four winds, and formed and fought to battle through."
fought;--;doc3.txt;--;Because we've always fought to bring all of our people under the blanket of the American Dream.
fought;--;doc2.txt;--;The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag.
development;--;doc4.txt;--;It is painfully obvious that corruption stifles development - it siphons off scarce resources that could improve infrastructure, bolster education systems, and strengthen public health.
try;--;doc5.txt;--;9/11 showed us that try as we might to ignore the rest of the world, our enemies will no longer ignore us.
try;--;doc2.txt;--;You understand that in this election, the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result.
way;--;doc4.txt;--;I wish all of you luck in finding this courage in the days and months to come, and I want you to know that as your ally, your friend, and your brother, I will be there to help in any way I can.
way;--;doc3.txt;--;They can say that this was the time when America found its way.
way;--;doc5.txt;--;And on a trip to the former Soviet Union, I have seen the biological and nuclear weapons terrorists could easily steal while the world looks the other way.
way;--;doc2.txt;--;As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home.
way;--;doc1.txt;--;But Washington has a long way to go.
way;--;doc6.txt;--;Outstanding career officials who run the Nunn-Lugar program -- people like Col. Jim Reid and Andy Weber who are here this morning -- will be there every step of the way to ensure that U.S. interests are protected.
series;--;doc5.txt;--;Now, I am hopeful that the Iraq Study Group emerges next month with a series of proposals around which we can begin to build a bipartisan consensus.
forward;--;doc4.txt;--;Instead of unifying the country to move forward on solving problems, it divides neighbor from neighbor.
forward;--;doc1.txt;--;It will take your time, your energy, and your advice - to push us forward when we're doing right, and to let us know when we're not.
forward;--;doc6.txt;--;For any of these efforts that I've mentioned to work as we move forward, we must also think critically and strategically about Washington's relationship with Moscow.
forward;--;doc5.txt;--;And so going forward, I believe there are strategic lessons to be learned from this as we continue to confront the new threats of this new century.
forward;--;doc2.txt;--;Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend.
walls;--;doc3.txt;--;We're tired of being divided, tired of running into ideological walls and partisan roadblocks, tired of appeals to our worst instincts and greatest fears.
factions;--;doc4.txt;--;Among African nations, Kenya remains a model for representative democracy - a place where many different ethnic factions have found a way to live and work together in peace and stability.
factions;--;doc5.txt;--;The goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of Iraq, prevent a further descent into civil war, and push the various Iraqi factions towards a political solution.

war;--;doc3.txt;--;And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the American people about why we are there and how we will win.
war;--;doc5.txt;--;The National Intelligence Estimate, which details how we’re creating more terrorists in Iraq than we’re defeating, is the most obvious example of how the war is hurting our efforts in the larger battle against terrorism.
war;--;doc2.txt;--;I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan.
war;--;doc1.txt;--;Finally, there is one other thing that is not too late to get right about this war - and that is the homecoming of the men and women - our veterans - who have sacrificed the most.

differences;--;doc6.txt;--;"Let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved...For in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet.
differences;--;doc5.txt;--;And all the troops in the world won’t be able to force Shia, Sunni, and Kurd to sit down at a table, resolve their differences, and forge a lasting peace.
differences;--;doc2.txt;--;Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend.

hoped;--;doc5.txt;--;When I first advocated steps along these lines over a year ago, I had hoped that this phased redeployment could begin by the end of 2006.
failure;--;doc1.txt;--;What's stopped us is the failure of leadership, the smallness of our politics - the ease with which we're distracted by the petty and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough decisions, our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems.
failure;--;doc6.txt;--;Not to mention the environmental and public health and safety catastrophe that could come from a failure to store and transport these materials safely and securely.
failure;--;doc5.txt;--;But I have long believed it has also been a failure of conception ?
failure;--;doc2.txt;--;Well it's time for them to own their failure.

line;--;doc2.txt;--;But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy.
true;--;doc4.txt;--;In a true democracy, it is what happens between elections that is the true measure of how a government treats its people.

made;--;doc3.txt;--;He was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the Republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the Democrats should come down to just two words:Had enough?
made;--;doc5.txt;--;Instead of consolidating the gains made by the Karzai government, we are backsliding towards chaos.
made;--;doc2.txt;--;When John McCain said we could just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights.
made;--;doc1.txt;--;We've made some progress already.
made;--;doc6.txt;--;Fortunately, however, we've made some good progress on this front.

understood;--;doc1.txt;--;That's what Abraham Lincoln understood.
understood;--;doc3.txt;--;And I understood the question because it revealed the cynicism people feel about public life today.
whether;--;doc4.txt;--;And you will determine the direction of this country in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger Kenya where everyone rises together.
whether;--;doc3.txt;--;Whether it's the war or Katrina or their health care or their jobs, you hear people say that we've finally arrived at a moment where something must change.
whether;--;doc5.txt;--;And so the question is not whether there is some magic formula for success, or guarantee against failure, in Iraq.
whether;--;doc2.txt;--;The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight.
dangerous;--;doc6.txt;--;And it will be dangerous.
dangerous;--;doc3.txt;--;The party that will harness homegrown, alternative fuels and spur the production of fuel-efficient, hybrid cars to break our dependence on the world's most dangerous regimes.
dangerous;--;doc5.txt;--;The overwhelming presence of our troops, our intelligence, and our resources in Iraq has stretched our military to the breaking point and distracted us from the growing threats of a dangerous world.

commit;--;doc5.txt;--;If we commit our troops anywhere in the world, it is our solemn responsibility to define their mission and formulate a viable plan to fulfill that mission and bring our troops home.
commit;--;doc2.txt;--;And we will keep our promise to every young American - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education.
fathers;--;doc4.txt;--;Certainly it is not due to lack of effort on the part of ordinary Kenyans - we know how hard Kenyans are willing to work, the tremendous sacrifices that Kenyan mothers make for their children, the Herculean efforts that Kenyan fathers make for their families.
fathers;--;doc2.txt;--;But we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need.
foresight;--;doc1.txt;--;For the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight.
foresight;--;doc3.txt;--;It allows us to say to the child who didn't have the foresight to choose the right parents or be born in the right suburb - pick yourself up by your bootstraps.
foresight;--;doc5.txt;--;Such lack of foresight is simply inexcusable.
record;--;doc2.txt;--;If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from.

stories;--;doc4.txt;--;I know from these stories that my father was not a perfect man - that he made his share of mistakes and disappointed his share of people in his lifetime.
stories;--;doc6.txt;--;We've heard the horror stories - attempts by rogue states to recruit former Soviet weapons scientists; terrorists shopping for weapons grade materials on the black market.
stories;--;doc2.txt;--;Theirs are the stories that shaped me.
abuses;--;doc4.txt;--;The Kenyan people are the ultimate guardians against abuses.
abuses;--;doc6.txt;--;Additionally, in the last few years, we've seen some disturbing trends from Russia itself - the deterioration of democracy and the rule of law, the abuses that have taken place in Chechnya, Russian meddling in the former Soviet Union - that raise serious questions about our relationship.
problem;--;doc4.txt;--;But while corruption is a problem we all share, here in Kenya it is a crisis - a crisis that's robbing an honest people of the opportunities they have fought for - the opportunity they deserve.
problem;--;doc3.txt;--;But there's just one problem.
problem;--;doc5.txt;--;any U.S. strategy must address the problem of sectarian militias in Iraq.

called;--;doc3.txt;--;We know that we've been called in churches and mosques, synagogues and Sunday schools to love our neighbors as ourselves; to be our brother's keeper; to be our sister's keeper.
called;--;doc5.txt;--;Americans called for this more serious policy a few Tuesdays ago.
called;--;doc2.txt;--;And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future.
russian;--;doc6.txt;--;Additionally, in the last few years, we've seen some disturbing trends from Russia itself - the deterioration of democracy and the rule of law, the abuses that have taken place in Chechnya, Russian meddling in the former Soviet Union - that raise serious questions about our relationship.
russian;--;doc2.txt;--;But I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression.
regimes;--;doc6.txt;--;Right now, rogue states and despotic regimes are looking to begin or accelerate their own nuclear programs.
regimes;--;doc3.txt;--;The party that will harness homegrown, alternative fuels and spur the production of fuel-efficient, hybrid cars to break our dependence on the world's most dangerous regimes.
regimes;--;doc5.txt;--;In the past, it has been movements for freedom from within tyrannical regimes that have led to flourishing democracies; movements that continue today.
promises;--;doc1.txt;--;But too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and the special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own.
promises;--;doc3.txt;--;Enough of the broken promises.
promises;--;doc2.txt;--;When Washington doesn't work, all its promises seem empty.
sometimes;--;doc4.txt;--;I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see.
began;--;doc4.txt;--;I began to understand and appreciate the distance he had traveled - from being a boy herding goats to a student at the University of Hawaii and Harvard University to the respected economist that he was upon his return to Kenya.
began;--;doc3.txt;--;And she began to cry.
asking;--;doc6.txt;--;And so the question we need to be asking ourselves today is, what is the future of this program?
asking;--;doc5.txt;--;To reach such a solution, we must communicate clearly and effectively to the factions in Iraq that the days of asking, urging, and waiting for them to take control of their own country are coming to an end.
certain;--;doc1.txt;--;I recognize there is a certain presumptuousness - a certain audacity - to this announcement.
certain;--;doc5.txt;--;The redeployment could be temporarily suspended if the parties in Iraq reach an effective political arrangement that stabilizes the situation and they offer us a clear and compelling rationale for maintaining certain troop levels.
certain;--;doc2.txt;--;And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most.
measure;--;doc4.txt;--;In a true democracy, it is what happens between elections that is the true measure of how a government treats its people.
measure;--;doc1.txt;--;Each of us, in our own lives, will have to accept responsibility - for instilling an ethic of achievement in our children, for adapting to a more competitive economy, for strengthening our communities, and sharing some measure of sacrifice.
measure;--;doc2.txt;--;Now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution.
influence;--;doc3.txt;--;The party who believes that in this democracy, influence and access should begin and end with the power of the ballot.
influence;--;doc5.txt;--;namely, preventing Iraq from becoming what Afghanistan once was, maintaining our influence in the Middle East, and forging a political settlement to stop the sectarian violence so that our troops can come home.
influence;--;doc2.txt;--;It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work.
direction;--;doc4.txt;--;And you will determine the direction of this country in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger Kenya where everyone rises together.
direction;--;doc6.txt;--;And the Kiev story is heading in the right direction - while we were in Ukraine, Dick, through his tireless and personal intervention, was able to achieve a breakthrough with that government, bringing that facility and others under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program.
direction;--;doc3.txt;--;They are longing for direction.
water;--;doc1.txt;--;We welcomed immigrants to our shores, we opened railroads to the west, we landed a man on the moon, and we heard a King's call to let justice roll down like water, and righteousness like a mighty stream.
water;--;doc2.txt;--;Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology.
single;--;doc1.txt;--;Every single person willing to work should be able to get job training that leads to a job, and earn a living wage that can pay the bills, and afford child care so their kids have a safe place to go when they work.

exist;--;doc5.txt;--;We must always reserve the right to strike unilaterally at terrorists wherever they may exist.
rule;--;doc4.txt;--;The history of Africa is a history of ancient kingdoms and great traditions; the story of people fighting to be free from colonial rule; the heroism of not only of great men like Nkrumah and Kenyatta and Mandela, but also ordinary people who endured great hardship, from Ghana to South Africa, to secure self-determination in the face of great odds.
rule;--;doc6.txt;--;Additionally, in the last few years, we've seen some disturbing trends from Russia itself - the deterioration of democracy and the rule of law, the abuses that have taken place in Chechnya, Russian meddling in the former Soviet Union - that raise serious questions about our relationship.
senate;--;doc6.txt;--;Five postal employees were killed and the Senate office buildings were closed for months.
senate;--;doc3.txt;--;But whenever I get in that mood, I think about something that happened to me on the eve of my election to the United States Senate.
politics;--;doc4.txt;--;It is rooted in the bankrupt idea that the goal of politics or business is to funnel as much of the pie as possible to one's family, tribe, or circle with little regard for the public good.
politics;--;doc1.txt;--;Politics doesn't have to divide us on this anymore - we can work together to keep our country safe.
politics;--;doc3.txt;--;It's the timidity - the smallness - of our politics that's holding us back right now.
politics;--;doc5.txt;--;a strategy no longer driven by ideology and politics, but one that is based on a realistic assessment of the sobering facts on the ground and our interests in the region.
politics;--;doc2.txt;--;Change happens because the American people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time.
education;--;doc4.txt;--;It is painfully obvious that corruption stifles development - it siphons off scarce resources that could improve infrastructure, bolster education systems, and strengthen public health.
education;--;doc1.txt;--;It was in these neighborhoods that I received the best education I ever had, and where I learned the true meaning of my Christian faith.
education;--;doc3.txt;--;That in a global economy that's more connected and more competitive - we are the party that will guarantee every American an affordable, world-class, top-notch, life-long education - from early childhood to high school, from college to on-the-job training.
education;--;doc2.txt;--;And we will keep our promise to every young American - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education.

trip;--;doc6.txt;--;Time and time again on the trip, I saw their skill and experience when negotiating with the Russians.
trip;--;doc3.txt;--;At one point, Kozol tells about his trip to Fremont High School in Los Angeles, where he met a girl who tells him that she'd taken hairdressing twice, because there were actually two different levels offered by the high school.
trip;--;doc5.txt;--;And on a trip to the former Soviet Union, I have seen the biological and nuclear weapons terrorists could easily steal while the world looks the other way.

commander-in-chief;--;doc2.txt;--;As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home.
factory;--;doc3.txt;--;My mother is a seamstress in a factory.
factory;--;doc2.txt;--;When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed.
mutual;--;doc3.txt;--;But it has also depended on our sense of mutual regard for each other, of mutual responsibility.
mutual;--;doc2.txt;--;Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility - that's the essence of America's promise.
disappointments;--;doc4.txt;--;As our parents' children, we have the opportunity to learn from these mistakes and disappointments.
deserve;--;doc4.txt;--;In today's Kenya - a Kenya already more open and less repressive than in my father's day - it is that courage that will bring the reform so many of you so desperately want and deserve.
deserve;--;doc2.txt;--;I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination.
peace;--;doc4.txt;--;Among African nations, Kenya remains a model for representative democracy - a place where many different ethnic factions have found a way to live and work together in peace and stability.
peace;--;doc1.txt;--;Letting the Iraqis know that we will not be there forever is our last, best hope to pressure the Sunni and Shia to come to the table and find peace.
peace;--;doc5.txt;--;And all the troops in the world won’t be able to force Shia, Sunni, and Kurd to sit down at a table, resolve their differences, and forge a lasting peace.
peace;--;doc2.txt;--;And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future.
percent;--;doc2.txt;--;I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a ten percent chance on change.
intend;--;doc5.txt;--;Such a reduced but active presence will also send a clear message to hostile countries like Iran and Syria that we intend to remain a key player in this region.
intend;--;doc2.txt;--;And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States.
reality;--;doc5.txt;--;a policy based on blind hope and ideology instead of fact and reality.
reality;--;doc2.txt;--;The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang-violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals.
rally;--;doc3.txt;--;And ever since I met this frail, one-hundred-and-five-year-old African-American woman who had found the strength to leave her house and come to a rally because she believed that her voice mattered, I've thought about all she's seen in her life.
started;--;doc6.txt;--;But when we think about the threat that these weapons pose to our global security, we cannot allow the U.S.-Russian relationship to deteriorate to the point where Russia does not think it's in their best interest to help us finish the job we started.
started;--;doc3.txt;--;We've seen our children leave for Iraq and terrorists threaten to finish the job they started on 9/11.
politicians;--;doc4.txt;--;The Kenyan media has been courageous in uncovering and reporting on some of the most blatant abuses of the system, and there has been a growing recognition among people and politicians that this is a critical issue.
politicians;--;doc1.txt;--;I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill.
conditions;--;doc5.txt;--;But to guard against isolationist sentiments in this country, we must change conditions in Iraq and the policy that has characterized our time there ?
role;--;doc1.txt;--;And although government will play a crucial role in bringing about the changes we need, more money and programs alone will not get us where we need to go.
role;--;doc6.txt;--;Everyone has a role to play, and everyone must accelerate this involvement.
role;--;doc3.txt;--;The reason they don't believe government has a role in solving national problems is because they think government is the problem.
transport;--;doc6.txt;--;While they are often difficult to use, they are easy to transport, hard to detect, and, as we saw in Kiev, not always well secured.
sick;--;doc2.txt;--;Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent.
forge;--;doc3.txt;--;We are here tonight because we believe that in this country, we have it within our power to say "yes" to those questions - to forge our own destiny - to begin the world anew.
forge;--;doc5.txt;--;And all the troops in the world won’t be able to force Shia, Sunni, and Kurd to sit down at a table, resolve their differences, and forge a lasting peace.
compete;--;doc1.txt;--;Let us be the generation that reshapes our economy to compete in the digital age.
compete;--;doc3.txt;--;No longer can we assume that a high-school education is enough to compete for a job that could easily go to a college-educated student in Bangalore or Beijing.
compete;--;doc2.txt;--;Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy.
kenyan;--;doc4.txt;--;By rejecting the insulting idea that corruption is somehow a part of Kenyan culture, these heroes reveal the very opposite - they reveal a strength and integrity of character that can build a great country, a great future.
ambitions;--;doc4.txt;--;What's worse - corruption can also provide opportunities for those who would harness the fear and hatred of others to their agenda and ambitions.
ambitions;--;doc5.txt;--;We know these countries want us to fail, and we should remain steadfast in our opposition to their support of terrorism and Iran’s nuclear ambitions.
gaining;--;doc4.txt;--;When African nations were just gaining independence, industrialized nations had decades of experience building their domestic economies and navigating the international financial system.
happens;--;doc4.txt;--;In a true democracy, it is what happens between elections that is the true measure of how a government treats its people.
happens;--;doc1.txt;--;And when all else fails, when Katrina happens, or the death toll in Iraq mounts, we've been told that our crises are somebody else's fault.
happens;--;doc2.txt;--;Change happens because the American people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time.
briefly;--;doc4.txt;--;I learned about the brutal repression of Operation Anvil, the days of rape and torture in the "Pipeline" camps, the lives that so many gave, and how my grandfather had been arrested briefly during this period, despite being at the periphery of Kenya's liberation struggles.
briefly;--;doc6.txt;--;My third recommendation - which I'll just touch briefly on and let Senator Lugar talk about in more detail - is that we need to start thinking creatively about some of the next-generation efforts on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons.
elements;--;doc1.txt;--;As Lincoln organized the forces arrayed against slavery, he was heard to say: "Of strange, discordant, and even hostile elements, we gathered from the four winds, and formed and fought to battle through."
elements;--;doc6.txt;--;For my part, I would suggest three important elements that should be included in such a discussion.
fuel-efficient;--;doc1.txt;--;We can harness homegrown, alternative fuels like ethanol and spur the production of more fuel-efficient cars.
fuel-efficient;--;doc3.txt;--;The party that will harness homegrown, alternative fuels and spur the production of fuel-efficient, hybrid cars to break our dependence on the world's most dangerous regimes.
fuel-efficient;--;doc2.txt;--;I'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America.
brothers;--;doc4.txt;--;In addition, we know that the more information the public is provided, the easier it will be for your Kenyan brothers and sisters out in the villages to evaluate whether they are being treated fairly by their public servants or not.
brothers;--;doc3.txt;--;I've thought about how she lived to see a world war and a Great Depression and a second world war, and how she saw her brothers and uncles and nephews and cousins coming home from those wars and still have to sit at the back of a bus.
brothers;--;doc2.txt;--;I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination.
congress;--;doc4.txt;--;In just the last year, our own U.S. Congress has seen a representative resign after taking bribes, and several others fall under investigation for using their public office for private gain.
congress;--;doc1.txt;--;I was proud to help lead the fight in Congress that led to the most sweeping ethics reform since Watergate.
congress;--;doc6.txt;--;In the years ahead, this should become an increasing priority for the Nunn-Lugar program, the Congress, and the Russians, who are already taking important steps to help implement these programs.
congress;--;doc5.txt;--;This must end in the next session of Congress, when we reassert our authority to oversee the management of this war.
congress;--;doc2.txt;--;If you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves.
living;--;doc1.txt;--;Every single person willing to work should be able to get job training that leads to a job, and earn a living wage that can pay the bills, and afford child care so their kids have a safe place to go when they work.
living;--;doc3.txt;--;I've had enough of Katrina survivors living out of their cars and begging FEMA for trailers.
living;--;doc2.txt;--;The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight.
lesson;--;doc5.txt;--;The final lesson is that in an interconnected world, the defeat of international terrorism ?
bribe;--;doc4.txt;--;And we also know that the more people there are on the government payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe.
problems;--;doc4.txt;--;Instead of unifying the country to move forward on solving problems, it divides neighbor from neighbor.
problems;--;doc1.txt;--;What's stopped us is the failure of leadership, the smallness of our politics - the ease with which we're distracted by the petty and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough decisions, our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems.
problems;--;doc3.txt;--;We know that government can't solve all our problems - and we don't want it to.
problems;--;doc2.txt;--;Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology.
ultimately;--;doc5.txt;--;Rather, the question is what strategies, imperfect though they may be, are most likely to achieve the best outcome in Iraq, one that will ultimately put us on a more effective course to deal with international terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and other critical threats to our security.
visits;--;doc6.txt;--;But lately we haven't seen many of these visits.
replace;--;doc1.txt;--;For the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight.
replace;--;doc2.txt;--;But we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need.
sure;--;doc6.txt;--;We need to be sure that Nunn-Lugar is increasingly focused on these very real non-proliferation and bioterrorism threats.
sure;--;doc2.txt;--;And we will keep our promise to every young American - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education.
chance;--;doc4.txt;--;And the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests.
chance;--;doc1.txt;--;It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people - as Americans.
chance;--;doc3.txt;--;And then someday, someday, if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the 21st century, they can say that this was the time when America renewed its purpose.
chance;--;doc2.txt;--;And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance.
important;--;doc4.txt;--;You enjoy a robust civil society; a press that's free, fair, and honest; and a strong partnership with my own country that has resulted in critical cooperation on terrorist issues, real strides in fighting disease and poverty, and an important alliance on fostering regional stability.
important;--;doc6.txt;--;It's important for senior officials to go and visit these sites, to check their progress and shortcomings; to see what's working and what's not.
katrina;--;doc1.txt;--;And when all else fails, when Katrina happens, or the death toll in Iraq mounts, we've been told that our crises are somebody else's fault.
katrina;--;doc3.txt;--;I've had enough of Katrina survivors living out of their cars and begging FEMA for trailers.
genocide;--;doc4.txt;--;It can shield a war criminal - even one like Felicien Kabuga, suspected of helping to finance and orchestrate the Rwandan genocide - by allowing him to purchase safe haven for a time and robbing all humanity of the opportunity to bring the criminal to justice.
genocide;--;doc2.txt;--;I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease.
twenty-first;--;doc3.txt;--;And I've wondered - if she is lucky enough to live as long as 105-year-old Marguerite Lewis, if she someday has the chance to look back across the twenty-first century, what will she see?
twenty-first;--;doc2.txt;--;But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy.
wounded;--;doc3.txt;--;I've had enough of being told that we can't afford body armor for our troops and health care for our veterans and benefits for the wounded heroes who've risked their lives for this country.
wounded;--;doc5.txt;--;They have seen their sons and daughters killed or wounded in the streets of Fallujah.
hopefulness;--;doc4.txt;--;But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict.
friends;--;doc1.txt;--;I made lasting friendships here - friends that I see in the audience today.
friends;--;doc3.txt;--;A seat had opened up, and some friends asked me if I'd be interested in running.
friends;--;doc5.txt;--;This means talking to our friends and, at times, even our enemies.
friends;--;doc2.txt;--;I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise.
died;--;doc5.txt;--;2,867 Americans have now died in this war.
died;--;doc2.txt;--;The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag.
opened;--;doc1.txt;--;We welcomed immigrants to our shores, we opened railroads to the west, we landed a man on the moon, and we heard a King's call to let justice roll down like water, and righteousness like a mighty stream.
opened;--;doc3.txt;--;A seat had opened up, and some friends asked me if I'd be interested in running.
building;--;doc4.txt;--;By focusing on building strong, independent institutions - like an anti-corruption commission with real authority - rather than cults of personality, they make a contribution to their country that will last longer than their own lives.
building;--;doc1.txt;--;I want us to take up the unfinished business of perfecting our union, and building a better America.
building;--;doc6.txt;--;We entered through no fences or discernible security, and once we did, we found ourselves in a building with open first-floor windows and padlocks that many of us would not use to secure our own luggage.
building;--;doc3.txt;--;Who said we're going to keep on dreaming, and we're going to keep on building, and we're going to keep on marching, and we're going to keep on working because that's who we are.
militias;--;doc5.txt;--;Of course, in order to convince the various factions to embark on the admittedly difficult task of disarming their militias, the Iraqi government must also make headway on reforming the institutions that support the military and the police.
land;--;doc4.txt;--;And we know how much this land is blessed - just as the entire African continent is blessed - with great gifts and riches.
land;--;doc2.txt;--;And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream.
longer;--;doc4.txt;--;By focusing on building strong, independent institutions - like an anti-corruption commission with real authority - rather than cults of personality, they make a contribution to their country that will last longer than their own lives.
longer;--;doc1.txt;--;It is because of the millions who rallied to his cause that we are no longer divided, North and South, slave and free.
longer;--;doc3.txt;--;No longer can we assume that a high-school education is enough to compete for a job that could easily go to a college-educated student in Bangalore or Beijing.
longer;--;doc5.txt;--;9/11 showed us that try as we might to ignore the rest of the world, our enemies will no longer ignore us.
longer;--;doc2.txt;--;But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy.
assume;--;doc1.txt;--;It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable - that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst.
assume;--;doc3.txt;--;No longer can we assume that a high-school education is enough to compete for a job that could easily go to a college-educated student in Bangalore or Beijing.
invest;--;doc1.txt;--;Let's make college more affordable, and let's invest in scientific research, and let's lay down broadband lines through the heart of inner cities and rural towns all across America.
invest;--;doc3.txt;--;I've had enough of giving billions away to the oil companies when we're told that we can't invest in the renewable energy that will create jobs and lower gas prices and finally free us from our dependence on the oil wells of Saudi Arabia.
invest;--;doc2.txt;--;I'll invest in early childhood education.
moved;--;doc1.txt;--;But through his will and his words, he moved a nation and helped free a people.
moved;--;doc2.txt;--;I've seen it in Illinois, when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work.
required;--;doc5.txt;--;What is absolutely clear is that it is not enough for the President to respond to Iraq’s reality by saying that he is “open to” or “interested in” new ideas while acting as if all that’s required is doing more of the same.
marguerite;--;doc3.txt;--;And I've wondered - if she is lucky enough to live as long as 105-year-old Marguerite Lewis, if she someday has the chance to look back across the twenty-first century, what will she see?
finished;--;doc4.txt;--;I had just finished three years of work as a community organizer in low-income neighborhoods of Chicago, and was about to enroll in law school.
finished;--;doc6.txt;--;But this is one story that shows our job is far from finished at a time when demand for these weapons has never been greater.
together;--;doc4.txt;--;And you will determine the direction of this country in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger Kenya where everyone rises together.
together;--;doc3.txt;--;We know that there are some things we do better together.
together;--;doc5.txt;--;For only through this phased redeployment can we send a clear message to the Iraqi factions that the U.S. is not going to hold together this country indefinitely ?
together;--;doc2.txt;--;That together, our dreams can be one.
together;--;doc1.txt;--;Together, starting today, let us finish the work that needs to be done, and usher in a new birth of freedom on this Earth.
together;--;doc6.txt;--;And we need to work together to obtain a bilateral agreement on biological threat reduction.
notion;--;doc5.txt;--;“rejected the notion of an American ‘timeline’ for action on urgent Iraqi political issues; ordered American commanders to lift checkpoints they had set up around the Shiite district of Sadr City to hunt for a kidnapped American soldier and a fugitive Shiite death squad leader; and blamed the Americans for the deteriorating security situation in Iraq.”This is now the reality of Iraq.
daughters;--;doc5.txt;--;They have seen their sons and daughters killed or wounded in the streets of Fallujah.
daughters;--;doc2.txt;--;It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot.
mass;--;doc6.txt;--;For a scientist or other employee to simply walk out of the lab with enough material to construct a weapon of mass destruction is far too easy, and the consequences would be far too devastating.
mass;--;doc5.txt;--;and most importantly, the prevention of these terrorist organizations from obtaining weapons of mass destruction -- will require the cooperation of many nations.
fact;--;doc4.txt;--;In fact, one recent survey showed that corruption in Kenya costs local firms 6% of their revenues, the difference between good-paying jobs in Kenya or somewhere else.
fact;--;doc3.txt;--;I've thought about the fact that when she was born, there weren't cars on the road, and no airplanes in the sky.
fact;--;doc5.txt;--;a policy based on blind hope and ideology instead of fact and reality.
time;--;doc4.txt;--;Since that time I have known him through stories - those my mother would tell and those I heard from my relatives here in Kenya on my last trip to this country.
time;--;doc3.txt;--;They can say that this was the time when America learned to dream again.
time;--;doc5.txt;--;And it is time to refocus America’s efforts on the wider struggle yet to be won.
time;--;doc2.txt;--;In the young people who voted for the first time, and in those who got involved again after a very long time.
time;--;doc1.txt;--;And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you.
time;--;doc6.txt;--;Time and time again on the trip, I saw their skill and experience when negotiating with the Russians.
push;--;doc4.txt;--;When it broke down in front of Uhuru Park, we had to push until some joakalis came to fix it by the side of the road.
push;--;doc1.txt;--;It will take your time, your energy, and your advice - to push us forward when we're doing right, and to let us know when we're not.
push;--;doc5.txt;--;The goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of Iraq, prevent a further descent into civil war, and push the various Iraqi factions towards a political solution.
serious;--;doc6.txt;--;Additionally, in the last few years, we've seen some disturbing trends from Russia itself - the deterioration of democracy and the rule of law, the abuses that have taken place in Chechnya, Russian meddling in the former Soviet Union - that raise serious questions about our relationship.
serious;--;doc5.txt;--;Americans called for this more serious policy a few Tuesdays ago.
serious;--;doc2.txt;--;The times are too serious, the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook.
overseas;--;doc3.txt;--;And as a result, we've seen families work harder for less and our jobs go overseas.
overseas;--;doc2.txt;--;Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America.
starting;--;doc4.txt;--;Today, we're starting to see that the Kenyan people want more than a simple changing of the guard, more than piecemeal reforms to a crisis that's crippling their country.
starting;--;doc1.txt;--;Together, starting today, let us finish the work that needs to be done, and usher in a new birth of freedom on this Earth.
starting;--;doc2.txt;--;And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman.
mireya;--;doc3.txt;--;I've often thought about Mireya and her simple dream and all those before her who've shared that dream too.
refused;--;doc4.txt;--;As well as numerous Kenyan men and women who have refused to pay bribes to get civil servants to perform their duties; the auditors and inspectors general who have done the job before them accurately and fairly, regardless of where the facts have led; the journalists who asked questions and pushed for answers when it may have been more lucrative to look the other way, or whip up a convenient fiction.
refused;--;doc3.txt;--;And she knew that during those moments in history where it looked like we might give up hope or settle for less, there have always been Americans who refused.
